# Treasures and Trolls

Treasures and Trolls is a game about adventure. In this game, one person, who is called the treasure master or TM, must create a story for the rest of the players. Players imagine they are part of the story, choosing the actions for their characters. It is the job of the TM to create a world for the players to explore and determine the outcome of their actions. Together, the TM and the players create a story.

The most important rule in T&T is there are no rules. Everything is this guide book is just a suggestion to resolve the player actions, and the actions of the other non player characters in the game, into outcomes that move the story forward. The actions and outcomes are limited only by creativity, so the TM must often improvise new rules, new spells, and new monsters to fit the situation. For that reason, the guidebook is designed to be as minimal as possible. The rest is left up to the imagination and creativity of the TM.

## Magic Dice

In order to resolve actions into outcomes, the TM uses dice to represent the whims of chance. If every character knew the outcome of their actions before they make a decision, there would be no risk, and no adventure.

T&T uses a special type of 12‑sided die based on the geometry of a tesseract. A tesseract is a four‑dimensional hypercube, and when it’s projected into three dimensions it forms a 12‑sided solid called a rhombic dodecahedron. Unlike common 12‑sided dice, which use pentagonal faces, tesseract dice use rhombus‑shaped faces, essentially squares that have been stretched or skewed into a diamond shape. This shape comes directly from the projection: the faces of a tesseract are squares, and when those squares are mapped from four dimensions down to three, they become the rhombus faces of the die.

The other interesting effect of using a tesseract is they can been stacked in 3 dimensions. Just like a cube can be stacked together in 3 dimensions, tesseracts can be stacked the same way in 4 dimensions. This is called a tessellation. So, this is why when you project the tesseract back to 3 dimensions, the rhombic dodecahedron can also be stacked in 3 dimensions, just like a cube.

Another way to understand the projection from 4 to 3 dimensions is to look at a hexagon as a 2 dimensional projection of a cube. If you take a regular cube, and rotate it so you look at it directly from the corner, you can see this shape is naturally a hexagon. Take a hexagon, and divide it into 3 rhombus shaped diamonds, and you can now see clearly its just a cube 'squashed- or projected onto 2 dimensions. And, just like a rhombic dodecahedron, hexagons can be stacked or tessellated in 2 dimensions, to fill a piece of paper (or a map). This is why hexagons can be used like graph paper (which is a 2D tessellation or a 2D square) as a map.

## The Magic Curve

T&T addresses a common issue present in other role-playing games related to probabilistic outcomes. Many RPG systems rely on either a d20 or d100, which employ a flat probability distribution. This can result in situations where, due to bonus modifiers, some actions become impossible to succeed regardless of the dice roll. As a solution, these systems frequently assign automatic success to rolling a "natural" 20, representing optimal circumstances. The core issue, however, lies not with the modifiers or specific scenarios, but rather with the inherent limitations of a flat dice system. T&T overcomes this challenge by implementing "magic" dice and a "magic" curve, thereby offering a more nuanced probabilistic model.

A twenty'sided die yields a natural 20 five percent of the time, or one in twenty. The distinctive dice used in T&T generate a probability curve that addresses this issue. These dice are numbered from 0 to 10, with a special symbol ⬡ on the twelfth face. A standard roll in T&T involves three dice, and summing all three produces a probability distribution known as a bell curve. This distribution means that, as more dice are rolled, results tend to cluster around the average, while the likelihood of achieving very high or very low totals diminishes.

For example, if a first level fighter attacks a large dragon with a great sword, the probability of delivering a fatal blow is extremely low. Even a one in twenty chance for a "natural" 20 would be unrealistic for such an encounter. However, with the magic curve, the cumulative probability of scoring 30 or higher is approximately 1%, and the chance of rolling maximum possible score of 33 is less than 0.06%. This allows a much wider range of outcomes, even the nearly miraculous outcome of a first level fighter striking off the head of a dragon in one blow. A flat d20 simply doesn-t allow for the range and diversity of outcomes that magic dice do.

The reason the magic curve works the way it does is that in order to score 33, you need to roll the max roll on all 3 dice. There are 12 sides on each die, making a total of 12 x 12 x 12 combinations total, or 1728 .- And there is only one roll out of all 1728 that adds up to the perfect 33. However, there are 3 combination that make 32, so it is 3 times more likely to score 32 than 33. There are 6 different rolls that make 31, so thats about twice as likely than 32, and so on. And, in the middle are 16 and 17, which are both the most likely score. There are 108 combinations that add up to 16 and 108 that add up to 17, making them both the most likely scores at 6.3%. If you divide the scores in half, there is exactly 50% chance to score 16 or lower, and 50% chance to score 17 or higher.

### Basic Dice Check Roll

Unless specified otherwise, all dice rolls in T&T use a basic roll of 3 magic dice. Each die has numbers 0-10, plus the **⬡** symbol. Just add the total of all 3 dice. The **⬡** counts as 11, and for each **⬡** you roll, you can re-roll one other die. If you roll 2 **⬡**, you can re-roll the third die twice. Even if you roll **⬡** again on a re-roll, you get another free re-roll. So, for example, lets say you roll **⬡**, a 2 and a 3. You could just choose not to re-roll any of the other dice, or if you want to improve your roll, you could take the 2 and roll that one again. And, if you are lucky enough to roll another **⬡**, you could then choose to re-roll the third die too.

A dice check roll is written as -DC- and a number, for example -DC 17-. This means make a basic dice roll, and if the result is equal to or greater than the DC number, the DC is successful. Many DC rolls get to add an ability modifier, for example DC 17 (INT) lets you add your INT ability bonus modifier to the roll. -Most DC rolls also have a level modifier as well, as characters go up in levels they may get bon uses to certain actions. Unless otherwise noted, general rule of thumb is any character gets a +1 per 4 levels on all DC checks. In many cases a DC can also be modified by an ability or level modifier of the person or creature performing the action which the target is making a DC against. For example, lets say someone is trying to detect if another character is lying to them. The person performing the DC is the person trying to detect the lie, they get an ability modifier (WIS) and level bonus (+1/4 levels). But, the person telling the lie also gets a bonus based on ability (CHR) which is a penalty to the first person's DC. In some cases they also might or might get their own level bonus, but unless there is some class specific bonus for -lying-, that would not apply in this case. But, for other actions (like spell casting) this might be the case.

Some DC rolls have multiple outcomes, for example DC(STR) 17 / 20, is like rolling DC 17 and DC 20 on the same roll. If your roll is 17 -19, you achieve the first outcome, 20 or higher is the second, etc. This is usually for actions that have progressive levels of success depending on your DC roll.

#### Standard Action Difficulty Classes

Most actions can be grouped together simply by difficult, as easy, medium, hard, or very hard. This is an easy way to quickly decide how to determine the result of an action. Just decide how hard it is, and which character ability (if any) will modify it. In some cases, the target may also get it's own ability modifier.

Use the following chart to determine the DC roll for a standard action.- If finer tuning is desired you can adjust the roll, for example medium+1 would be a DC 21.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Difficulty** | **DC** | **Failure Chance** |
| Very Easy | 14  | 32% |
| Easy | 17  | 50% |
| Medium | 20  | 78% |
| Hard | 23  | 83% |
| Very Hard | 26  | 93% |

Some common activities can be grouped easily into these difficulty classes.- These are just examples which can be used as guidelines for other actions. Also, most actions should be modified based on the specific circumstances. For example, is it dark out?-- Is the character being chased?

| **Difficulty** | **Actions** | **Ability Modifier** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Very Easy | Climb a ladder | Dex |
| Easy | Jump over a 5 foot gap | Dex |
| Medium | Locate secret doors | Wis |
| | Find traps | Wis |
| | Hide in shadows | Dex |
| | Move Silently | Dex |
| | Vault over a 5 foot wall | Dex |
| Hard | Jump a 10 foot gap | Dex |
| | Climb a castle wall | Dex |
| | Take an object without being noticed | Dex |
| | Know when someone is lying | Wis |
| Very Hard | Do a backflip | Dex |

Each action has different consequences for failure. Failure to find a secret door only means that action failed. But failure to jump a 10 foot gap would mean the character would fall into the gap. When actions fail, the TM must determine what the consequences are, usually by specifying additional actions and difficulties necessary. For example, if they fail to successfully jump across a deep chasm, they would require another hard difficulty action to grab onto the ledge, and another medium difficulty to climb back up, or else fall into the chasm to certain death.

It's important to understand that any action the players choose to take can be resolved this way, especially when there are no other rules to resolve a situation. All the other rules in T&T are designed to help find a way to resolve a players action, but there are always situations that cant be anticipated. Rather than try to create a new rule for every scenario, T&T allows the TM to resolve any action in a way that makes sense in the context where it arises. -----

#### Low Failure Probabilities

The standard actions are meant for actions where there is reasonable chance of failure. If the chance of failure is below about 25%, those kind of actions generally don-t need a roll to succeed, because they are most likely going to succeed anyway. However, some actions DO need a failure check, if the consequences of failure are severe. The chance of safely, for example, galloping on horse, is over 95%. But, the consequences of failure might be severe injury or death of a player. So, in some cases even when the chance of failure is very low, you may need a way to resolve an action with a very small chance of failure. Using the table of probabilities for a standard dice check, you can determine the DC needed for any probability actions:

| **Failure Chance** | **DC** |
| --- | --- |
| .25% | 2   |
| 1%  | 4   |
| 2%  | 5   |
| 5%  | 7   |
| 10% | 9   |


**Using regular 12 sided dice:**
If standard Treasure and Trolls dice are not available, of course the game can be played with any common 12 sided dice, with the following substitutions:  

| **Roll** | **Substitution** |
| --- | --- |
| 0-11 | None needed |
| 11 | Count as ⬡ |
| 12 | Count as 0 |

#### Basic Dice Rolls
T&T is meant to be played using only T&T magic dice, although other kinds of dice can be included.  When needed, the T&T d12 can be used to substitute for other kinds of dice as well, and this is often needed when playing the game if you need to generate random outcomes other than 1-12.  The notation d4, d6, etc. is used for a number between 1 and the number of outcomes, so d4 is 1-4.  The notation 2d4, etc. is used when you want to add the result of multiple dice, so for 2d4, roll d4 2 times and add the result.  And, often the result can be modified by adding or subtracting a number, like d3-1 would be a d3 minus 1, resulting in a range of -1 to +1.

| **Roll** | **d2** | **d3** | **d4** | **d6** | **d12** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 12 |
| 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| 5 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 5 |
| 6 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 6 |
| 7 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 7 |
| 8 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 5 | 8 |
| 9 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 9 |
| 10 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 6 | 10 |
| ⬡ | 2 | 3 | 4 | 6 | 11 |

Sometimes you want a roll to start from 0 instead of 1, especially when combining with other rolls. Use this table for 0 based rolls, using the notation z instead of d to be clear the numbering starts at 0.

| **Roll** | **z2** | **z3** | **z4** | **z6** | **z12** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 |
| 3 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 3 |
| 4 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 4 |
| 5 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 5 |
| 6 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 6 |
| 7 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 7 |
| 8 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 4 | 8 |
| 9 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 9 |
| 10 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 10 |
| ⬡ | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 11 |

Its not uncommon to need a larger range than d12 allows on its own, but if you just add the result of multiple dice, it creates a bell curve in the results.  If you need a flat or uniform distribution larger than d12, results can be combined to generate larger ranges, such as d18 or d24, by combining multiple rules.  For example, d18 is d6 + z3 x 6, and d24 is d12 + z2 x 12. In order to have the total outcome range starting from 1, the second roll has to start from 0 to make a sliding window to add to the first roll to expand the result across the desired ranges  The second roll is always multiplied by the number of sides of the first die.  For example, if you need a d24, first roll d12, then roll a z2, and if the result of the second roll is 1, add 12 to the first roll.  For d18, roll a d6, then z3.  If the z3 results in 1, add 6 to the first roll, and if it’s a 2, add +12.

**Bell Curve Rolls**

Bell curve rolls result whenever you directly add the results of multiple dice.  The more dice you add the more the curve is weighted to the middle of the range. This is noted by b2 or b3 to denote adding 2 or 3 dice.  In this notation, it is always a standard T&T d12.  Bell curve rolls always use zero based roles, z12, which makes the math simpler. A basic roll in fact is the same as b3, except when rolling b3, you dont reroll any dice if you roll ⬡.  Bell curve rolls normally are just trying to get a range weighted to the middle and using a reroll for ⬡ would just skew the outcome for no reason.  To create a bell curve and also reduce the range, this is done by starting with z4 or z6 instead of z12, which is noted by /2 or /3, for example b2/2 is b2 rolled with z6 instead of z12, resulting in a range 0-10, and b3/3 is b3 rolled using z4 instead of z12, resulting in a 0-9 range.  This is an important difference, for example 2d6 and b2/2 are essentially the same role, but 2d6 results in a 2-12, and b2/2 results in 0-10.  b2/2 +2 would be identical to 2d6. 


### Alignment

Character alignment can apply to an individual or also monster species. Alignment determines the moral choices a character will make.

\- Lawful - Law and order form the foundation of civilization. It is built on the assumption that individuals respect the rights of others in society, including the right to personal property and the right to be treated justly under laws applied equally to all. Without this foundation, civilization can not stand. The idea of honor is fundamental to the lawful alignment. -Those who have honor and are committed to defend rights of others, weak or powerful alike, are lawful in alignment.

\- Chaotic - Chaos is the opposite of a lawful alignment. Individuals aligned with chaos reject the fundamental idea of individual rights or equality. For those aligned with chaos, might makes right. Individuals can and should take what they want by force. It is the law of the jungle. Not only do chaotic individuals have no honor, they reject the idea of honor. Honor and justice are for suckers.

\- Neutral - Neutral individuals exist between the two extremes of law and chaos. There is a place for honor and justice, just as there is a place for enlightened self interest. A truly neutral alignment places value in flexibility above rigidity. To make the right decision but to acknowledge that the circumstances may call for both law and order or at times to make exceptions to those laws.

### Character Abilities

Each character has six core abilities, determined by rolling scores from 0 to 33 at creation. Players roll seven scores and assign each to their preferred ability for a customized character.

**Strength:** Determines physical power, lifting capability, and effectiveness in melee combat. Characters with higher Strength are able to carry heavier loads, break through barriers, and excel in physical challenges. Ability modifiers for strength apply to attack power for melee attacks.

**Constitution:** Reflects a character's health, stamina, and resilience to physical challenges. Higher Constitution allows characters to withstand injuries, recover faster from fatigue, and survive in harsh environments. This ability is essential for enduring prolonged exertion and resisting diseases or toxins. Ability modifiers for constitution are applied as a bonus to the character's toughness.

**Dexterity:** Synonymous with agility, dexterity measures reflexes, and balance, impacting a character's ability to dodge attacks, move silently, and perform tasks that require fine motor skills. Characters with high Dexterity excel in ranged combat and can react quickly to sudden dangers. Ability modifiers for dexterity are applied as a bonus on to hit rolls.

**Intelligence:** Represents a character's reasoning, memory, and ability to learn. High Intelligence allows characters to solve complex problems, analyze situations, and recall important information, making them adept at strategy and academics.

**Wisdom:** Indicates a character's intuition, perception, and judgment. Characters with high Wisdom are adept at sensing their environment, making thoughtful decisions, and resisting mental influences. This ability is vital for tasks involving awareness, insight, and spiritual or magical understanding.

**Charisma:** Reflects a character's social influence, leadership, and ability to inspire or persuade others. Characters with high Charisma can negotiate favorable outcomes, build alliances, and command attention in social situations. This ability is important for diplomacy, deception, and rallying allies.

**Wealth**: This is not an actual character ability, but when creating a new character, the player assigns the 7th roll to wealth, which indicates starting money. This is also part of the character's background history. Being well equipped is especially important for a low level characters, so when starting out the player must choose one of there seven rolls as a tradeoff to determine how much money they will have to buy equipment.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Score** | **Class** | **Starting Money** |
| 0-6 | Surf | 1-6 sp |
| 7-12 | Peasant | 3d12 sp |
| 13-18 | Freeman | d4 +2 x 10 sp |
| 19-23 | Tradesman | 2d6 + 4 x 10 sp |
| 24-28 | Gentry | d4 +2 x 100 sp |
| 29-32 | Nobility | (2d4 + 4) x 100 sp |
| 33  | Royalty | 3d12 x 100 sp + a valet, mount, and livery |

**Ability Modifier Bonuses**

Based on the score, each ability will grant a bonus for specific actions. Above 30, each additional point is an additional +1 modifier, up to 33 which would be +6.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Ability Level** | **Modifier** |
| 30  | +3  |
| 27-29 | +2  |
| 23-26 | +1  |
| 6-8 | \-1 |
| 4-5 | \-2 |
| 0-3 | \-3 |

**\[EXP\] - Exceptional Character Ability Rules**

Abilities can have a large impact on hoe powerful a character can become. This puts alot of pressure on whihc abilities get rolled. In order to get better scores, sometimes players may want to roll up many characters and pick the best scorees out of many. In order to allow a party to have above average abilities without going through the charade of rolling up dozens of characters, the GM can choose to give each character a boost on all their rolls. A party of adventurers should represent individuals who have been hardened by their experiences and training, and may have higher than normal ability scores. Use the following chart to choose a bonus:

**Character Ability Modifiers:**

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Ability Level** | **Modifier** |
| Above Average | +2  |
| Exceptional | +4  |
| Extraordinary | +6  |
| Hero | +8  |
| Super Hero | +10 |

### Money

Understanding the economic system within this realm is crucial for comprehending the lifestyle, trade, and social hierarchy that define it.

A copper piece (cp) represents the basic unit of currency, equating to a day's labor for an unskilled laborer, ditch digger, or a common peasant. Household servants typically earn between 2 to 3 coppers per day, while skilled craftsmen can command around 5 coppers daily. Skilled craftsmen like blacksmiths, stonemasons or carpenters might earn 5-10 coppers per day through practicing their own trades. This is partly sue to the guild system which only a guild member can learn or practice those craft skills. --Attendants to a noble, such as valets or ladies-in-waiting, might earn 6 to 7 coppers per day. -The master of servants for a noble household could earn as much as 1-2 silver pieces (sp) per day, this person would be responsible for managing the staff for an entire estate, and would be a wealthy person in their own right, for a person of common birth. A gold piece (gp) is a significant amount of money, which would be considered a valuable treasure for a peasant, reflecting its substantial worth in this economic framework. Unskilled laborers would probably never see a gold piece in their entire lifetimes. -Adventurers walking around with pockets filled with gold from a dungeon would be considered extremely wealthy.

To further put the value of money in perspective, a noble or wealthy merchant may have from 10-30 sp on their person as -walking around- money. 1000 gp would be literally a -king's ransom-. -A small noble estate, including property, grounds, outbuildings, and main house would be worth as much as 3000-4000 gp, and a royal palace would be valued at 20,000 gp or more. 'so, to put things in perspective, a few gold coins would be a lot of wealth for the average person, but pocket change for a wealthy noble. -1000 gp or more would be considered unbelievable wealth for the average person, enough to retire on a tropical island somewhere. -And 10,000 gp would be significant wealth even for royalty.

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Currency** | **Abbreviation** | **Conversion** |
| Copper | Cp  | 1 cp |
| Silver | Sp  | 10 cp |
| Gold | Gp  | 10 sp |
| Platinum | Pp  | 10 gp |
| Mithril | Mp  | 1000 gp |

### Encumbrance

The basic unit of weight, simply referred to as a 'coin,' serves as a basic measure in the realm. Therefore, 50 coins collectively weigh about 1 pound. However, bulky or awkward objects may actually encumber more than small, compact or easily caried items. So, coins is more- measurement of how much an item will encumber a person than literal weight.

Encumbrance is a critical factor in determining an adventurer's mobility and overall effectiveness in their journeys. Carrying too much weight can slow down characters, reducing their speed and agility. Adventurers must carefully consider the weight of their treasure, equipment, and other items to avoid becoming overburdened. A heavily encumbered character may struggle to dodge attacks, climb obstacles or escape from danger quickly. Proper management of encumbrance ensures that adventurers maintain optimal performance in various situations, balancing the need for essential gear with the ability to move unimpeded.

For each 3 points of strength, a character's base encumbrance amount is 500 coins. So, a character with a 30 strength would have a base encumbrance amount of 5000 coins, or about 100 pounds.

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Encumbrance modifier** | **Encumbrance** | **Movement penalty** | **Combat Penalty** | **Run Speed** |
| 0-1 | Light | 0   | 0   | 4x base speed |
| 1-2 | Medium | 2/3 | \-3 | 4x base speed |
| 2-3 | Heavy | 2/3 | \-6 | 3x base speed |

### Equipment

When it comes to equipping these characters, the right choice of weapon can make a significant difference in their combat effectiveness. The table below provides an overview of various weapons and their respective attack power, allowing players to strategically select the best armaments for their adventurers.

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Weapon** | **Price (sp)** | **Weight** | **Attack Power** | **Effect** |
| longsword | 15-30 | 250 | 5   |     |
| shortsword | 10-20 | 175 | 4   |     |
| Dagger | 2-20 | 100 | 2   |     |
| Spear | 10-20 | 300 | 4   | reduces armour toughness by -1 |

**Armor**

Armor works by giving a character a bonus to toughness, reducing all physical attack damage. Most armor is heavy and bulky, but instead of being counted against a character's encumbrance, it is counted as a direct modifier to the base movement speed. Also, heavier armor makes it much more difficult to avoid being hit, so it both reduces a character's natural dodge bonus from dexterity, and may even give an innate dodge penalty. For example, full plate armor has a -4 dodge penalty, which basically gives an attacker a +3 to hit. It also has a -2 dodge penalty penalty, so if a character has a +3 dodge bonus from dexterity, that would be reduced to +1 when wearing full plate armor.

## Indoor Adventuring

### Rounds and Turns

When adventuring indoors, time is divided into turns and rounds. A turn takes 1 minute, and a combat round is 6 seconds. When exploring a hostile location, the party will move carefully to avoid running in to monsters or traps, or getting lost. The normal unit of time for exploring an indoor location is a turn.

### Movement

Indoor movement is normally on a square grid. Each square is equal to 5 feet. The party will have a number of movement points equal to the slowest party member. Moving 1 square will cost 1 movement point. The party may also move diagonally which will cost 1.5 movement points.

### Random Encounters

When exploring a dungeon, roll a DC 21 each 3 turns to determine if a random encounter occurs. The DC required can be adjusted for each dungeon if there are more or fewer wandering monsters. Each dungeon should have its own modifier for random encounters.

If a wandering monster is encountered, fist roll 2d12 x 5 feet to determine the distance at which the party becomes aware of the encounter. Add the highest WIS modifier for the party. The monsters may be around a corner or in another room, depending on distance. If the encounter is > 30 feet distance, roll a DC of 1 per 5 feet away to determine if the monster initially is aware of the party, so for example, if the encounter occurs at a distance of 100 feet, the monster or monster group must roll DC 20 to detect the party, otherwise they may be unaware, allowing the party an opportunity for a surprise attack. The monster DC roll is modified by the highest dexterity modifier in the party, and if the party has a thief, then there is an additional -2 penalty to detect the party. Note the monster must also be detected as any other normal encounter. Many monsters use concealment or trickery to deceive the party, so the normal rules must apply before the party becomes aware they are in danger.

The monster which is encountered depends on which level the party is on. Higher level dungeons have more difficult random encounters.

### Adventuring Party

Whenever a random encounter indicates an encounter with an adventuring party, use these instructions to create a random adventuring party.

Roll d6 to determine how many adventurers are in the party.

For each adventurer, the adventurer's experience level will be based on the level of the dungeon the encounter occurs on, plus d3-2. In an outdoor environment, the base level will be determined by rolling d6.

First roll 1d3 to determine the party's alignment. When encountering a chaotic party, they will often lie to deceive the party about their true nature.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|     | **Party Alignment** |
| 1   | Lawful |
| 2   | Neutral |
| 3   | Chaotic |

  
To determine the race of each adventurer, make a basic roll and use the following table

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|     | **Race** |
| 0-16 | Human |
| 17-20 | Halfling |
| 21-24 | Elf |
| 25-33 | Dwarf |

Next make another basic roll to determine the class

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|     | **Class** |
| 0-17 | Fighter |
| 18-21 | Magic User |
| 22-27 | Thief |
| 29-33 | Cleric |

If the adventurer class is fighter or cleric, roll d6 and use the following table to determine the type of armor they wear. A thief will always be equipped with leather armor. Magic user's wont be wearing armor.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|     | **Armor** |
| 1   | Chain |
| 2   | Chain |
| 3   | Chain |
| 4   | Plate |
| 5   | Plate |
| 6   | Plate |

Roll d6 to determine which weapon each adventurer uses. Elven melee classes are more likely to use a longbow and never use axes or crossbows, so treat any roll for an axe or crossbow as longbow instead. Fighters, thieves and clerics will also carry a shield if they have a one handed weapn.

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     | **Fighter** | **Magic User** | **Thief** | **Cleric** |
| 1   | Long Sword | Dagger | Dagger | Mace |
| 2   | Axe | Dagger | Dagger | Mace |
| 3   | Great Axe | Dagger | Short Sword | Mace |
| 4   | Great Sword | Staff | Short Sword | Staff |
| 5   | Long Bow | Staff | Long Bow | Staff |
| 6   | Crossbow | Staff | Crossbow | Staff |

Finally, each adventurer may be equipped with magic equipment. For each adventurer, roll DC 25 to determine if the adventurer is equipped with magic, and add +2 to the check for each level above 1. If the check succeeds, for d3 to determine if they have a magic weapon or armor.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|     | **Magic Item** |
| 1   | Magic Weapon |
| 2   | Magic Armor |
| 3   | Both |

Use the standard item bonus table to determine what the magic item bonus is. If a magic user has magic armor, it will be a cloak of protection. Also, if a magic user has a magic weapon, it will be a random staff or wand. Roll d2, 1 is a staff, 2 is a wand. If a cleric is equipped with a magic weapon, and the roll indicates they use a staff, roll DC 25 to check if it is a staff of healing, with a +2 for each level of the cleric.

Finally, each adventurer will be carrying coins using the treasure table for a monster 2 level above their level.

## Outdoor Adventuring

### Movement

Outdoor movement is based on movement points for a hex based map with a 1 mile hex. For other scales, simply adjust the movement points per hex accordingly.

Base movement points is 8 points per 10 feet of base movement rate, so for example humans have a base movement of 30 feet, which gives them 24 movement points per day.

A riding horse has a base movement rate of 60 feet, and a base encumbrance of 350 pounds. When riding a horse, movement and encumbrance all work the same way for the horse as normal movement, so a mounted rider would have 48 movement points.

The party must move together, so they are limited to the speed of the slowest person in the party. Movement points are based on terrain and if the party is following a road or path. Movement overland is much more challenging then following a path. Even on open terrain, you have gopher holes, furrows, and terrain irregularities, so following a path or track is always easier and the party can cover ground faster that way. The following table lists the movement points per hex:

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Terrain** | **Road** | **Path** | **Overland** |
| Plains | .8  | 1   | 1.2 |
| Desert | .8  | 1   | 1.2 |
| Forest | .8  | 1   | 1.2 |
| Swamp | 1.2 | 1.5 | 2   |
| Badlands | 1.2 | 1.5 | 2   |
| Mountains | 1.5 | 2   | 3   |

### Random Encounters

Every 6 hexes of movement, roll a DC 23 to determine if a random encounter will occur. Some regions on the map are more dangerous, so the DC check will be modified based on how dangerous each region is.

If a wandering encounter occurs, roll 3d12 times 10 yards to determine the distance, adding the WSI modifier for the party member with the highest WIS bonus. The monster must roll DC 1 for every 10 yards away in order to become aware of the party, so for example the monster must roll DC 20 if the encounter occurs at 200 yards. The party may subtract the highest dexterity modifier from the roll and another -2 if the party has a thief. If the monster is unaware of the party, they may choose to surprise the monster or try to avoid the encounter.

Use the following table to determine which monster is encountered:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Roll** |     |
| **0** | Doppelganger |
| **1** | Mimic |
| **2** | Hell Hound |

Roc

Giant eagle

Terror bird (flightless dire emu)

Smilodon

Tiger (Siberian, tropical)

Lion

Wyvern

Flying pterosaur (also possible mount)

## Treasure

Many adventuring parties believe treasure is the whole point of defeating monsters. Even random wandering monster encounters offer a chance to find treasure nearby. For a wandering monster, roll DC 21 to determine if there is a monster lair nearby which has treasure. Even if the check is successful, the party still needs to locate the lair. Some monsters, especially intelligent or humanoid monsters, may also place traps near or in the lair, so the party must beware as they search.

If a treasure is found, roll determine what kind of treasure is found:

### Money

Use the following table to determine how much money is found, for each monster in the encounter. For instance, if the party encountered a group of 3 level 1 goblins, roll 3 times on this table at level 1.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Monster Level** | **Price (sp)** |
| 1   | 2d12 cp |
| 2   | d3 sp |
| 3   | d6 sp |
| 4   | 2d6 sp |
| 5   | d3 gp |
| 6   | d6 gp |
| 7   | 2d6 gp |
| 8   | 2d12 gp |
| 9   | d12 pp |
| 10  | 4d12 pp |

### Gems and Jewelry

Roll DC 23 to determine if the treasure also contains gems or jewelry, modified by +1 for each monster in the encounter. So, if there were 3 level 1 goblins, the party needs a 21 or higher on the roll. But, if the treasure includes gems and or jewelry are found, roll d6 once to determine how many gems or jewelry are found, regardless of how many monsters were encountered. Use the following table to determine the value of each gem or jewelry:  
  

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Monster Level** | **Price (sp)** |
| 1   | d12 cp |
| 2   | d3 sp |
| 3   | d6 sp |
| 4   | 2d6 sp |
| 5   | d3 gp |
| 6   | d6 gp |
| 7   | 2d6 gp |
| 8   | d12 gp |
| 9   | 2d12 gp |
| 10  | 4d12 gp |

### Magic items

Magic items are exceptionally rare. -Most of them will provide a significant advantage to any party who possesses one. Also, when first found most magic items will appear to be perfectly normal if finely crafted item. A party should use a detect magic spell to determine if any items are enchanted, and identify to determine what they do and how to use them. Most items can-t be used properly until they are identified, such as scrolls, staves and wands, and others may be used but the effect would be unknown. So, for example a player may wield a +1 sword without identifying it, but they would not know if there was an advantage. For practical reasons, a TM can-t just add +1 to a damage of to hit roll without a player realizing an item is enchanted, so to keep the information unknown to the player, they simply wouldn-t get any bonuses until they identify the item. Only in a case where a bonus could be added in secret could a TM fairly give players bonuses on items they have not identified, but as a practical matter they just generally don-t get the bonus until the item is identified. Simply swinging a magic sword around is in no way the same thing as having it identified properly.

Roll DC 25 to check if any magic items are found. If the encounter level is above level 5, add +2 for each level above 5. If found, roll d3 to determine how many magic items are found, then roll b3 (no rerolls) and use the following table to check for each item what kind of magic item is found.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Roll** | **Item** |
| 0-8 | Magic weapon |
| 9-10 | Magic Armor |
| 11  | Magic Shield |
| 13  | Misc |
| 14-16 | Magic Scroll |
| 17-19 | Magic Potion |
| 20-21 | Magic Wand |
| 22-23 | Magic Staff |
| 24-28 | Magic Bracers |
| 29-33 | Magic Ring |

Use the following table to determine what kind of item is found:

  

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Roll** | **Weapon** | **Armor** | **Ring** | **Wand/Staff** | **Scroll** | **Potion** | **Misc** |
| 1   | Mace | Plate | Invisibility | Magic Missile | Invisibility | Invisibility | Cloak of Invisibility |
| 2   | Axe | Plate | Night Vision | Magic Missile | Charm Person | Polymorph Self | Cloak of Protection |
| 3   | Great Axe | Plate | Protection | Charm Person | Hold Person | Healing | Cloak of Protection |
| 4   | Dagger | Chain | Protection | Sleep | Hold Monster | Healing | Cloak of Protection |
| 5   | Short Sword | Chain | Attack Power | Healing | Sleep | Healing | Boots of Silence |
| 6   | Long Sword | Chain | Attack Power | Healing | Dispel Magic | Healing | Boots of Silence |
| 7   | Long Sword | Scale | Strength | Lightning | Wizard Lock | Strength | Boots of Speed |
| 8   | Great Sword | Scale | Dexterity | Lightning | Protection | Dexterity | Boots of Speed |
| 9   | Spear | Scale | Constitution | Lightning | Curse | Constitution | Boots of Speed |
| 10  | Short Bow | Leather | Intelligence | Fire Ball | Wall of Fire | Intelligence | Bag of Holding |
| 11  | Long Bow | Leather | Wisdom | Fire Ball | Lightning | Wisdom | Bag of Holding |
| 12  | Crossbow | Leather | Charisma | Fire Ball | Fireball | Charisma | Bag of Holding |

  

Once the item is determined, roll another basic b3 roll (including rerolls) to determine how powerful the item is. Use a progressive DC, so find the last column going from left to right where the number is less than the roll result, so if the roll is 28 for a first level monster, the item bonus is +2. The baseline result will always be at least +1, but based on the level and the roll, it may be up to +5

|     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Monster Level** | **+2** | **+3** | **+4** | **+5** |
| 1   | 27  |     |     |     |
| 2   | 25  |     |     |     |
| 3   | 23  | 33  |     |     |
| 4   | 21  | 30  |     |     |

| 9   | 9   | 17  | 28  | 31  |
| 10  | 7   | 15  | 27  | 30  |

**Weapons**:

Roll for weapon bonus. Weapon bonus is applied both to hit and to attack power.

**Armor**:

Roll for armor bonus. Armor bonus is applied as a bonus to toughness for the wearer. Also, when worn magic armor will not encumber the wearer, and has no effect on total carry weight or movement speed.

**Shields**:

Roll for the shield bonus. The shield bonus is applied as a to hit penalty for any attacker which can be blocked by the shield.

**Rings**:

\- Invisibility - When worn, the wearer is invisible, unless they cast spells or make any attacks. If they do this, they will become for one round each time they attack or use a spell.

\- Night Vision - the wearer can see in total darkness as if it where clear daylight.

\- Protection - Roll for item bonus. The bonus is applied as a bonus to toughness for the wearer.

\- Attack Power - Roll for item bonus. The bonus is applied both to hit and attack power for any melee or ranged attacks by the wearer.

\- Strength - Roll for item bonus. The bonus is applied to the wearer's strength attribute.

\- Dexterity - Roll for item bonus. The bonus is applied to the wearer's dexterity attribute.

\- Constitution - Roll for item bonus. The bonus is applied to the wearer's constitution attribute.

\- Intelligence - Roll for item bonus. The bonus is applied to the wearer's intelligence attribute.

\- Wisdom - Roll for item bonus. The bonus is applied to the wearer's wisdom attribute.

\- Charisma - Roll for item bonus. The bonus is applied to the wearer's charisma attribute.

**Wands and** **staffs**:

Wands and staffs are similar and can have similar attributes. Only a magic user can use a wand or staff, except for the healing wands or staff which may also be used by a cleric. The only difference is that staffs also roll for item bonus, and can be used to attack as a quarter staff and get the weapon bonus result like any other weapon. Also, any character class may use the staff as a melee weapon.

Both wands and staffs also have a limited number of charges. They can be recharged up to a maximum 24 charges in some larger cities. All wands and staffs start initially with 2d12 charges.

\- Magic Missile - Roll for item bonus. The resulting bonus is instead the number of missiles fired each time the item is used. This takes only 1 charge. If the bonus is 2 or more, the magic user must be at least level 2 to use the item, and that increases by 2 levels for each additional missile. So, a wand of magic missiles which fires 3 magic missiles per use can only be used by a 4th level magic user.

\- Charm Person - casts a charm person spell. For the purpose of saving throws, use the level of the item user using the item.

\- Sleep - casts a sleep spell. For the purpose of saving throws, use the level of the item user using the item.

\- Healing - Roll for item bonus. User must be a cleric only. Use the following table to determine the effect and level required for the item:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Item Bonus** | **Spell Effect** | **Level requirement** |
| 1   | Cure minor wound | 1   |
| 2   | Cure serious wound | 2   |
| 3   | Cure mortal wound | 4   |
| 4   | Raise dead | 5   |

\- Lightning - Casts lightning bolt as a magic user 2 levels above the item user's level. User must be at least a level 3 magic user.

\- Fire Ball - Casts fireball as a magic user 2 levels above the item user's level. User must be at least a level 3 magic user.

**Scroll**

Scrolls contain spells that can only be cast once. Only a magic user can use a scroll to cast the spell. Level requirements apply, but the item user get a +2 level bonus, so the user may cast a spell using a scroll as if they are 2 levels above their current level. The spell affects for each spell also get a + 2 level bonus, so for example a 3rd level magic user could use a fireball scroll to cast a fireball as a 5th level magic user, and only a 3rd level of higher magic user can use such a scroll.

**Potion**

Potions are small crystal vials containing about 1-2 ounces of fluid that must be drunk. Potion vials are surprisingly sturdy and wont easily break if dropped.

## Combat

### Initiative

Combat is normally divided into two sides, but in some cases it may be three or more. Either way, each side will roll for initiative, and the higher roll wins. The initiative roll is modified by the dexterity bonus of the party member with the highest agility. If there are more than one side each will have an opportunity to attack in order of the highest roll, and any tie must be decided by another roll between the sides which tied.

Once initiative has been determined, each side determines their actions in order. First the first team will move and choose combat actions, and then the second side will choose their movement and combat actions, until all sides have had an opportunity to go.

### Movement Phase

During movement phase, the party may choose to move or attempt to flee. If they choose to move, each character in the party moves in turn until they are out of movement points. Characters who wish to cast spells or take other actions may not move, so if a character wants to take one of these actions during combat phase, they need to forgo the movement phase.

If a party wants to attempt to flee, they may do so. If the other side in combat chooses to pursue, each side needs to roll. Each side gets +1 for each movement point, and they can also add the agility bonus of the party member with the highest agility. If the fleeing party gets the highest roll, they are successful in fleeing, but the party will end up 3 times their movement points away in a random direction. If they encounter a trap while fleeing, they will have a -4 penalty to avoid the trap.

### Combat Phase

Once movement is complete, the side which has initiative will choose to attack, cast spells, or perform other actions.

Attacking with a weapon involves 2 rolls. First, the attacker makes a roll to hit the target. This roll is modified by the dexterity bonus and any other to hit bonuses for the attacker against the doge, block, and other to hit reducing bonuses for the target. Other modifiers can be added based on character class and level, and other modifiers. Heavy armor can sometimes make the target less maneuverable and actually increase the chance to hit by adding a negative dodge bonus, but make up for it by reducing damage. Once all the modifiers have been added, the to hit roll must be > 16 in order to be successful. If the attack is a successful hit, the next roll is for damage.

The damage roll is modified by the attack power of the weapon and the toughness of the target. Target toughness represents the physical toughness, armor, as well as the skill and ability of the target to avoid being hit in a location which would cause a severe injury, like the head or neck, and instead by hit in a less vulnerable spot like the leg or shoulder. The toughness is also modified by armor. Heavier armor increases toughness and will reduce damage from the attack.

Once all the modifiers have been added to the damage roll, use the following table to determine the severity of the wound. Attack damage is measured only in the severity of the wound. Some of the damage affects are temporary, that may stagger or stun the target for a round or two. More severe wounds cause permanent damage until the wound is healed, reducing the target's combat effectiveness from a combination of pain, blood loss, or physical limb damage.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| **Roll** | **Wound** |
| 13  | **glancing blow**: -1 to hit, attack power and toughness for 1 round |
| 26  | **minor wound**: -1to hit, attack power and toughness until healed |
| 19  | **major wound**: target is staggered and unable to attack for 4 rounds, after which they are -4 to hit, attack power and toughness, and 50% movement speed until healed |
| 22  | **mortal wound:** target is knocked out and incapacitated for 1-3 days, during which they are unable to move and drift in and out of consciousness. -After 1-3 days, they my ST 21 (CON) or die. If the save is successful, the effects are the same as major wound until healed. |
| 25  | **instant kill**: the wound is so grave that the target dies immediately |


### Ranged
For ranged weapons, each weapon has a listed base range, which is considered short range.  Ranged weapon attacks can also be made at long or very long range, but with a to hit and attack power penalty, based on a multiplier of the weapon’s base range:

| **Range** | **Range Multiplier** | **To Hit Penalty** | **Attack Power Penalty** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Short | X1 | | |
| Long | X2 | -2 | -2 |
| Very Long | X3 | -5 | -5 |

### Healing

In order to heal naturally from wounds taken during combat, adventures will need to rest. -As long as the character continues to move or travel, the wound will not heal and the character will continue to suffer form it's effects. -While resting, the party must stay in one place, and they must be protected from the elements and have adequate food and water. However, if a character is suffering from multiple wounds, they all heal in parallel, not sequentially, so if a player has 3 minor wounds, they will all heal in the same time it would take to heal just one wound. Also, although healing is considered complete once the negative effects are overcome, but the wound will not be fully healed until twice that time. Other than aches and pains for the player, there are no additional effects from the wound during this period.

\- Minor wound - 2d4 days of rest. For multiple wounds, roll for healing time for each individual wound.

\- Major wound - 2d12 days of rest. Roll for healing time for each individual wound.

### Saving Throws\-------------

Saving throws are used in many circumstances to avoid damaging spell affects or other adverse outcomes. All saving throws have 3 characteristics:

\- Roll - the roll required for the save to be successful.

\- Ability modifier - Ability bonus (if any) to add to your save

\- Type of save - what class of attack or harm you must save against, for example poison, or magic. Magic saves often include a subcategory for what kind of magical effect, such as sleep or charm effects.

Saving throws are very common and used in many situations, and are usually abbreviated as just ST. So, for example ST 17 (CON / PSN) would be a saving throw requiring a roll of 17 against poison, using the constitution ability modifier. ST 21 (WIS / MAG'sLP) would be a saving throw of 21 required against magic (sleep), using wisdom bonus for a modifier.

Depending on the target's class, characters and monsters gain saving throw bonuses as they go up in level. Spell caster's also gain a bonus per level to make saving against their own spells more difficult, which is a penalty to the saving throw of any targets they cast a spell on. Also, in most cases the spell caster also gets an ability bonus against the save of it's target, again their bonus modifier is applied as a penalty against the save for the target. Unless otherwise specified, cleric's use wisdom for their ability bonus, and magic users use intelligence.

### Poison

Poison can be delivered as a powder, liquid, gas, on a weapon. Poisons can also affect its victim in a multitude of ways. These or the most common poison effects:

\- Poison - The most common poison simply causes death, which is so common, that if a poison affect is ever mentioned without specifying which kind of poison it is, its just assumed it causes death. Deadly poison ordinarily takes 1d4 combat rounds to incapacitate its victim, after which death will follow after 1d6 rounds of excruciating pain. Although the most common lethal poisons act this way, there are many many different specialized poisons. Some stop the heart, some are painless, some are odorless, etc.

\- Sleep - puts victim to sleep in 1d4 combat rounds that typically lasts for 1d6 hours, during which time the victim can not be woken. IF roused they will be incoherent and disoriented and immediately fall back asleep.

\- Paralysis - causes paralysis after 1d4 combat rounds that typically lasts for 1d6 hours. While paralyzed, the victim will remain awake and aware of what is happening, but unable to speak or act.

\- Amnesia - although much less common, poison can also block the formation of new memories. This is mainly interesting because the combination of sleep, paralysis, and amnesia renders the victim unconscious and immobilized. This combination can be used for performing medical procedures, although the three in combination can very easily cause an overdose resulting in death.

### Falling Damage

Falling damage is something that happens all the time in adventuring. Whenever a character or creature falls and takes damage, roll for damage using the standard damage tables, with an attack power of 5 + 1 for every foot they fall further than 5 feet. A character can safely fall 5 feet or less without the risk of taking damage.

The distance calculation is measured how far the actually fall. If a character is hanging from a 10 foot ledge, and they fall, they are only falling 5 feet or less, because they are already hanging from the ledge itself. So, if they are about 6 foot tall, and are you add 2 feet of extra reach because they are hanging by they arms, their feet are only 2-3 feet off the ground. So, make sure to calculate the actual fall distance correctly.

## Classes

### Experience and Levels

All characters gain levels by earning experience. At the end of each adventure session, the TM must add up all the experience earned by the party, and divide it equally among all the players. If any non player characters participate in the adventure, they also get an equal share of the experience, but if they were just hired mercenaries they only get - a share, because they did not contribute to making tough decisions to complete the adventure, they were just following orders.

Experience is given for defeating monsters, based on the level of the monster defeated. Experience is also earned for finding treasure, 1 xp per sp of value of treasure found, because completing an adventure is not always about killing monsters, and if the party can find another way to complete the adventure, they should be rewarded with experience. Bonus experience should also be awarded by the TM for overcoming challenges, or reaching certain goals, especially if the achievement involved actions other than killing monsters or finding treasure. For example, for escaping from a prison, or negotiating a treaty between two powerful kingdoms, or other things of a nature which ordinarily would not earn experience in accordance with the significance of the achievement.

All characters start at level 1. It takes 1500xp to reach level 2, and thereafter the amount of experience needed to reach the next level doubles for each level. So, 3000 at level 3, 6000 at level 4, etc. As a player becomes more experienced, it becomes progressively harder and harder to learn more and reach the next level.

Fighters are skilled warriors renowned for their combat prowess and versatility on the battlefield. They can come from any race and typically serve as the frontline defenders in an adventuring party. Fighters are proficient with a wide array of weapons and armor, allowing them to adapt to many different combat situations. Their rigorous training grants them increased toughness and resilience, making them difficult opponents to defeat in battle.

In addition to their physical strength, fighters often display tactical acumen, using their knowledge of warfare to protect allies and exploit their enemies- weaknesses. -As fighters gain experience and level up, they become even more formidable, gaining additional bonuses and improved toughness.

Starting at level 1, a fighter begins with a toughness rating of 2, to hit, dodge bonus and attack power bonus of 0. At level 2, 4, 6, and for each 2 levels thereafter, they gain an additional +1 to hit and dodge bonus. Attack power goes up by +1 every level, so that would be +1 at level 2, +2 at 3, etc. Toughness increases by +2 per level, so at level 2 they a toughness of 4, at level 3 they get 6, etc.

| 10  | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 2   |

### Thief

Races: any  
Armor: leather  
Toughness: +1/level  
To Hit: +1 / 3 levels  
Dodge: +1 level  
Saves:- +1 / level against disease, and poison, +1 / 2 levels for all other saves  
Attack Power: +1/ 2 levels  
Weapons: Staffs, all one handed melee weapons, bows, and crossbows

Special abilities: Pickpocketing, lockpicking, find traps, hide in shadows, move silently, back stabbing

Thieves specialize in burglary, assassination, and other skills necessary for breaking rules and taking things other people don-t want taken. Although stealing, theft and law breaking are often the reasons why someone would pursue this profession, they arent the only ones. The profession of thief offers skills aligned with spycraft as well as dungeon adventuring. Thievery is not unlawful when its is employed to separate a monster from its treasure.

Thieves have many skills important to their craft that require a dice check. For each of these skills, the thief gains an additional +1 modifier on the check for each level above 1, +1 at level 2, +2 at 3, etc.

\- Pickpocket - DC 18 (dex). This is an attempt to pilfer an item from on a person's body. A thief's intended victim may apply their wisdom ability modifier as a penalty to the thief's DC, as well as and addition -1 penalty per level above 1. This skill can also be used to remove an item from a table or shelf without being seen.

\- Pick lock - DC 16 (dex+int). This action will open any lock, but of course there will be a modifier based on the lock's difficulty. A -difficult- lock would be -3, -very difficult- -6, etc. Because picking a lock uses both manual skill as well as mechanical reasoning, the thief may add BOTH their intelligence and dexterity ability modifiers.

\- Find traps - DC 15 (wis). This is the only thief skill which requires wisdom instead of dexterity. Like picking locks, this check is modified by how well the trap is made to avoid detection, hard, very hard, etc.

\- Disarm traps - DC 17 (dex+int). This action will neutralize any trap. Like picking locks, this check is modified by how well the trap is made, hard, very hard, etc. Because disarming a trap uses both manual skill as well as mechanical reasoning, the thief may add BOTH their intelligence and dexterity ability modifiers. IF the thief fails the DC by more than 4 points, the trap will be set off, in most cases with the thief standing right in the target area.

\- Hide in shadows - DC 15 (dex). A thief may attempt to hide in shadows, or move while hidden at no more than 50% base movement rate. The creature the thief is hiding from may use their wisdom modifier as a penalty to the thief's hide in shadows attempt. Creatures above level 1 add an extra -1 penalty per level against the thief's DC. Only one check is needed per attempt, even when hiding from multiple creatures, but it applies individually using each one's level and wisdom modifiers; thus, the thief may hide from some creatures but not others. Actual cover or shadows are required, and the TM should adjust the check with situational bonuses or penalties: up to +8 for moonless nights with good cover, or -8 for bright, open areas.

\- Move silently - DC 15 (dex). Like hide in shadows, any creature who may notice the thief if this check fails may add a bonus modifier for wisdom, +1 for each level above one, as a PENALTY against the thief's DC. Also, like hide in shadows, the thief rolls one time for multiple creatures, and succeeds or fails on a one by one basis based on the level and wisdom modifiers for each creature.

\- Backstabbing - When a thief is in position to make an attack from behind and is undetected, they get +4 to hit and double their normal level based to hit bonus. If they hit, they get +6 attack power bonus at 1st level, and an additional +2 attack power for each level above 1. And, by undetected, this includes any other allies of the victim.- A call of -look out behind you- is enough to negate the bonuses of a back stab attack.

### Cleric\-------------------------

Race: any  
Armor: All  
Toughness: +2 / level  
To Hit: +1 / 2 levels  
Attack Power: +1 / level  
Saves:- +1 / level  
Weapons: Staff, mace

Special abilities: Turn undead, +1 saving throws versus magic per level. For each 2 levels, targets get an extra -1 penalty to save against spells cast by the magic user

Clerics are a combination of healer and holly warrior. They can cast spells, wear armor, but are forbidden to shed blood, which is why they are only allowed to use maces or staffs. Clerics are mostly prized for their healing powers, since most parties can not survive long without a good healer.

Clerics have the ability to turn undead below their level using a DC 24 (wis). For each level the cleric is above the level of the undead- -target, the cleric may add +2, but if the target is above the cleric's level, they get- penalty of -4 per level. The cleric may attempt to turn undead this one once per combat round, and if the attempt fails once for an individual target the cleric may not try again. IF turned, the undead will flee at maximum movement speed and can not return to the area until the cleric is gone.

Like magic users, clerics have a spell book of spells they have learned. At level 1, the cleric may choose 6 first level spells for their book. At level 2-3, they get to add 1 new spell when they level up. At level 4-5, they get 2, at level 6-7, they get 3 new spells, etc. adding another extra new spell acquired each 2 levels they go up.

Each day the cleric must choose which spells form their spell book to memorize. Use the following table to determine how many spells of each level they may use each day:

|     |     |     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Level** | **L1 spells** | **L2 spells** | **L3 spells** | **L4 spells** | **L5 spells** |
| 1   | 1   |     |     |     |     |
| 2   | 2   |     |     |     |     |
| 3   | 2   | 1   |     |     |     |
| 4   | 2   | 2   |     |     |     |
| 5   | 3   | 2   | 1   |     |     |
| 6   | 3   | 2   | 2   |     |     |
| 7   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   |     |
| 8   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 2   |     |
| 9   | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   |
| 10  | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 2   |

# Spells

The following is a list of common spells for all spell casters. However, the TM may choose to add new spells, either for a special encounter, for a non player character, or perhaps a new and unique spell which can be acquired from a vendor in a large city.

When a spell effect, either duration, range, damage, etc indicates it will scale with level, the level is the CASTER level, not the spell's level. Because spell users generally acquire a new spell level every 2 levels they go up, the maximum spell level a caster can use is usually one half of the caster's level +1.

Unless otherwise noted, ALL saves against any spell cast by the caster are subject to the caster's ability modifier as well as level bonuses. See the class description for each class to determine what bonuses the have. For a magic user, the INT ability modifier is applied, and WSI for a cleric. These bonuses are applied as a penalty against the save of the target, so if a magic user has a +2 INT bonus, the target must save at -2 against any spell cast by that magic user.

Also, unless otherwise noted, a spell caster may dismiss the effects of any spell they cast at any time before the duration is up. This will take up an action by the caster to do so.

## Clerical

### Level 1

**Command**  
Range: 40 feet

The caster may direct a single word instruction at a target within range. The target may roll ST (WIS/CHARM) (modified by caster wis) and if they fail, they will involuntarily follow the instructions. The subject can not choose how they comply, they will follow the instruction in the most obvious and plain way, but they also cant do something they wouldn-t ordinarily do voluntarily. So, die or even sleep are not things a person can ordinarily do on command, so that would have no effect, but commands like stop, run, go, etc. will cause them to follow that instruction.

**Create Water**  
Range: 30 feet

Create Water: This spell conjures up to 10 gallons of clean, drinkable water, instantly filling any nearby container specified by the caster. The water produced is fresh and safe for consumption. The spell requires a brief incantation and a gesture towards the intended vessel, after which the water appears as if poured from an invisible source. If summoned into the air, it will fall, and can be used to extinguish a small fire or to make somebody soaking wet.

**Cure Light Wound**  
Range: 10 feet

This spell channels energy into a single minor wound, gradually knitting flesh and closing the injury. The wound is not fully healed until after 1d4 rounds, but the wound location will remain tender and sore for the next day.

\-

**Delay Death**  
Range: 10 feet  
Duration: 1 day

This spell temporarily halts the dying process from a mortal wound, granting the target an extra day before death occurs. When cast, the spell stabilizes the individual, preventing further decline and allowing them to survive long enough for rescue or medical aid. During this time, the wound will not heal on its own, so the target remains in a fragile state-unable to stand or walk, but still able to whisper and communicate with others. The effect is ideal for buying time when immediate healing is unavailable, offering hope until help can be reached.

**Detect Evil**

For 10 minutes, the caster is able to sense the presence of evil creatures or objects within a 20-foot radius. When activated, the caster perceives a faint aura surrounding anything that is evil in nature. This detection works through walls and other obstacles, though it does not reveal the exact identity or motives of the source-only its presence and general direction. The spell requires focus and a brief prayer or gesture to initiate.

\-

**Detect Magic**  
Range: 20 feet

This spell reveals the presence of all magical items within 20 feet, even if they are hidden or concealed. For example, if a table contains many scrolls and vials of different liquids, and amongst them are 2 magical potions and one magical scroll, this spell will reveal exactly which ones have magical properties, and which don-t.

**Detect Poison**  
Range: 10 feet

This spell will reveal if any poison is on or in any objects within 10 feet. The object must be visible to the caster, but if for example a chest contains vials of poison within the chest, this spell will detect it. Its also accurate enough to detect the presence of poison needles for example on a trapped chest, indirectly revealing the presence of a trap itself, by detecting the poison therein.

**Light**  
Range: 10 feet  
Duration: 1 hour

This spell may be cast on any object which will illuminate the surrounding 20 foot radius area for the duration of the spell. The caster may terminate the spell at any time.

Range: 10 feet  
Duration: 10 minutes

Subject becomes protected from evil, gaining +1 dodge, toughness, and ST rolls vs. evil creatures, including demons, undead, evil humanoids and enchanted creatures, and any summoned creature summoned by an evil creature. Subject also can not be charmed or possessed by evil creatures while the spell is in effect.

**Purify Food and Water**  
Range: 10 feet

This spell will purify all non magical food and water in a 5 foot radius. Poison or disease effects are also removed. Food which has rotted or decayed beyond recognition will not be restored, generally anything older than 1 year, although foodstuffs designed to preserve naturally for multiple years anyway could be restored by this spell. You would not, for example, be able to -purify- the skeleton of an animal and turn it into edible flesh.

**Remove Fear  
**Duration: 10 minutes  
Range: 10 feet

This spell will remove magical or non magical fear effects from the target, and give them a bonus of +4 on all saves against fear. If they are currently under the influence of a fear spell, magical fear, or simple normal fear, the fear will abate and the target will feal courage in face of whatever they were frightened of.

**Sanctuary**  
Range: 30 feet  
Duration: 1 minute

As long as the subject of this spell does not attack or cast spells that would harm an enemy, anyone attack or cast a spell on the subject must roll ST 23 (WIS / MAGIC, modified by caster's WIS) or fail. -Attacks will miss and spells will disperse with no effect. While protected by sanctuary, the subject of the spell may cast beneficial spells, including healing, or other neutral spell effects, without breaking the sanctuary, so long as they do not attack or harm any other targets. Sanctuary will not protect the subject from area of effect attacks like dragon breath or a fireball, only spells or attacks that target the subject directly.

### Level 2

**Augury**

Augury is a divination spell that allows the caster to foresee the most probable outcome of a specific action they intend to take within the next 30 minutes. To perform the spell, the caster typically uses common divination tools such as bones, sticks, or other ritual components. By interpreting the patterns or movements of these materials, the caster receives an omen or sign that reveals whether the action will result in good, bad, or mixed consequences.

**Bless**  
Range: 30 feet  
Duration: 1 minute (10 combat rounds)

\-

**Calm**  
Range: 60 feet

All humanoids within a 20 foot circle of the target location must ST 23 (WIS / MAGIC) or be calmed. The caster's WIS modifier also modifies the saving throw. Calming causes the creature to stop combat and suppresses all hostile emotions for 1 minute. The victim will not initiate combat again unless attacked, until the spell ends. Stealing from the victim is considered a hostile action and might cause them to attack.

**Cure Serious Wound**  
Range: 10 feet

Similar to the cure light wound spell, this spell channels energy into a single major wound, gradually knitting flesh and closing the injury. The wound is not fully healed until after 1d4 rounds, but the wound location will remain tender and sore for the next day.

**Find Traps**  
Range: 40 feet

This spell will detect the presence of all traps in a 40 foot radius. The trap trigger mechanism or the trap itself must be in line of sight to the spell caster, so for example it won-t detect traps in other rooms nearby. If there are multiple traps in the spell area, all will be revealed. The spell also reveals the trigger mechanism for each trap, and any safety switches to disarm them, although if multiple switches must be triggered in a certain order, the spell will reveal the trigger switches but not which order they need to be triggered in to disarm the trap.

**Hold Person**  
Range: 60 feet  
Duration: 1 minute

One humanoid target must ST 20 (WIS/MAGIC) (subtract caster's INT bonus) or be held fast for 1 minute, unable to move, attack, or cast spells. The victim may speak normally while held.

**Resist Cold, Fire, or Lightning**  
Range: 10 feet  
Duration: 10 minutes / level

This is actually 3 different spells which must be learned and memorized separately, but they are very similar and the effects are the same. Grants the target +1 toughness per every 2 caster levels against damage from either fire, cold, or lightning. The target also gets +1 / 2 caster levels on ST versus the same.

**Silence (15 foot radius)  
**Range: 400 feet + 40 feet / level  
Duration: 1 minute / level  
Area of affect: 15 foot radius sphere

Creates a sphere around the target of absolute silence. No sound can be made withing the sphere, which will prevent spell casting. The target may be an object, a fixed location, or a creature. IF a creature is targeted, it will may save ST 19 (WIS / MAGIC, modified by caster's WIS). If the save is successful the spell is resisted and has no effect. This spell is especially useful for aiding a thief with moving silently.

### Level 3

**Create Food and Water**  
Range: 10 feet

Create Food and Water conjures wholesome nourishment, producing enough edible food and potable water to sustain up to three people for a full day. The conjured food is suitable for immediate consumption, providing basic sustenance but lacking extraordinary flavor or magical properties.

**Cure Mortal Wound**  
Range: 10 feet

This spell is able to cure even the most serious injuries. Cure mortal wound channels energy into a single mortal wound, gradually knitting flesh and closing the injury. The wound is not fully healed until after 1d4 rounds, during which time the target would still be in an incapacitated state due to their injuries. The wound location will remain tender and sore for the next day.

**Dispel Magic  
**Range: 120 feet

Dispel Magic is a spell designed to neutralize magical effects within its range. When cast, the spell targets either a specific magical effect, item, or area, attempting to remove ongoing enchantments, curses, or other supernatural influences. The caster must specify what they wish to dispel, and the spell then works to suppress or eliminate magical energy based on its power level and the caster's proficiency.

The primary effect of Dispel Magic is to end spells or magical effects that are currently active, such as illusions, enchantments, or protective wards up t any 3rd level spell. Spells level 4 or higher may ST 20+spell level (WIS/MAGIC). The WIS modifier for the original spell's caster is used on the ST, and the WIS modifier of the caster dispelling the spell is also added as a penalty to the ST.

**Locate Object**  
Range: 1000 feet  
Duration: 10 minutes

When cast the caster can locate any one specific object they know, and have seen, within 1000 feet, or the nearest object of a specific type, like a dagger or healing potion. Once the object is located, if it is moved or moving the caster will know where it is moving too for as long as the duration of the spell. The spell can also be cast on a person or creature, which will allow the caster to track it's movements for the duration of the spell. If the target is not willing, it may ST (21 WIS/MAGIC, subtracting caster's INT bonus) to avoid being tracked. However, if the caster chooses to track an object the target is carrying like a weapon or equipment, no saving throw is allowed.

**Magic Circle**  
Range: 10 feet  
Area of Effect: 10 foot radius sphere  
Duration: 10 minutes / level  
Casting Time: 10 minutes  
Material components: salt

The magic circle creates a magical circle of protection against evil or magical creatures, including magically summoned creatures, undead, demons, or enchanted creatures and humanoids of an evil nature such as gorgons, goblins, etc. Affected creatures can not enter, attack, or cast spells on anyone inside the circle. They can not willingly enter the circle, but if for any reason they DO enter the circle, they are immobilized in a manner similar to a hold person spell. They can not move, attack, or cast spells. However, any creature affected by the circle may roll ST 24 (WIS/CHARM, modified by caster's WIS) to resist its effects. Even if the ST succeeds, all creatures in the circle still gain +2 dodge, toughness, and ST bonus versus any attacks from the aforementioned creature classes.

Note that preparing the spell involves drawing a perfect circle in salt on the ground, and this can be laid in advance and concealed by placing a rug or covering over the salt circle, creating a potential trap for any evil creatures when the spell is invoked. Once the circle is prepared, the caster can wait any amount of time before completing the spell, which would take only one combat round. In fact, they can even use a circle prepared by another caster that they find already ready to use. However, the circle must be unbroken and must be perfect, so if anything happens to disturb the circle before the spell is completed it will fail and have no effect.

**Magic Vestment**  
Range: 10 feet  
Duration: 1 hour per level

This spell grants a +1 bonus per 4 caster levels to a suit of armor or shield for the duration of the spell. So, +1 at levels 1-4, +2 from 5-8, etc. The maximum bonus granted by this spell is +5.

**Prayer**  
Duration: 1 round per level  
Area of Effect: 40 foot radius around caster

After casting prayer, all allies within 40 feet gain +1 to hit, attack power, saving throws, and on all other actions. Any attacks on an ally within 40 feet are also made at -1 to hit, -1 attack power, and -1 on any other hostile actions. The effect remains as long as the allies remain within 40 feet of the caster for the duration of the spell.

**Preserve Corpse**  
Range: touch  
Duration: 1 day / level

Preserve Corpse halts the natural process of decay in a deceased body, maintaining its condition as if newly dead for the spell's duration. This not only prevents decomposition but also ensures that the corpse remains suitable for resurrection or raise dead spells, effectively extending the window in which such magics can be performed. The spell's effect is not limited to corpses, it can be cast on inanimate objects as well. When cast on up to 100 pounds of perishable food, it not only keeps it from spoiling but also keeps it fresh. There's nothing like 3 day old bread that tastes like it was baked that morning. The caster must touch the target, and for each level they possess, the preservation lasts an additional day, after which natural decay resumes unless the spell is recast.

**Remove Curse**  
Range: touch

Removes all curses from an object or person. IF the object is a cursed item, the curse is not removed by the item, but the curse would be lifted from any person's currently under it's curse effects. The next victim to trigger the curse from the magic item would still be cursed. In most cases, this allows a user or wearer to remove or discard a cursed item safely and escape the curse's effects.

**Speak with Dead**  
Range: 10 feet.  
Casting time: 10 minutes  
Duration: 1 minute / level

Temporarily animates a corpse or skeleton enough for it to speak. The caster may ask it a single question for every 2 levels of the caster. The corpse will answer in the simplest and most direct response possible, often with a single yes or no. The answer may be somewhat cryptic, so yes/no questions are the most reliable. If the corpse is an unwilling target, such that if it would not have, if alive, willingly answered the question, it may save ST 19 (MAGIC-CHARM). The save is modified by the caster's WIS, but the target does not get any modifiers for level, ability, or anything else.

Speak with dead does not recall the departed soul into the body, it just uses the body like a recorder to extract any information it would have had in life. Since the spell is not actually affecting the living creature the corpse once was, there are no level or ability benefits for it to resist, so the save is made as a dumb pile of inanimate flesh and bone.

One other benefit, since you aren-t actually speaking with the living creature, is it can speak common or whatever language the caster asks the question in, even if in life it could not.

**Water Walk**  
Range: 10 feet  
Duration: 10 minutes / level

Target my walk on water, including mud, ice, snow, etc. as if it were solid dry ground for the duration of the spell.

### Level 4

**Banishment**  
Range: 60 feet  
Duration: 1 minute

This spell banishes any being not from the material plane back to their plane of origin, which applies mainly to demons and spirits (including corporeal and non corporeal spirits). The target must save ST 26 (WIS/MAGIC). The caster may apply their WIS bonus as a penalty to the target's save. Once the spell begins, the target begins its transition to its home plane, during which they can not move or take any other action, however, the ritual takes 1 minute to complete, and if the caster is unable to complete the ritual, the spell will fail and the target will return to the material plane. If the caster is attacked during the ritual, or csn not complete the ritual for any reason the spell will fail-

**Control Water**  
Range: 400 feet + 40 feet/level  
Area of Effect: area 10 feet / level x 10 feet/level x 2 feet / level deep  
Duration: 10 minutes / level

The caster may raise or lower the level of water in a roughly square area about 10 feet per level on a side , by up to 2 feet / caster level. If this water is lowered in open water that's more that double the depth of the effect, it creates a powerful whirlpool as water is pulled into the area and flows out from the bottom. Small boats may capsize, and larger boats will become trapped in the area of effect unable to navigate up and out of the change in level of water caused by the effect . -If water is raised near the edge of a body of water so that it overflows the shore, then a powerful flow of spillage can occur as well, as water flows out from the area affected, if the body of water being raised is large enough to suppport that volume of flow. If the spell is used to lower the level of water in a river channel, it will effectively create a magical damn to stop the natural flow of water so long as the course of the water can not flow around the barrier on either side. -When water is damned this way the upstream water level may increase by as much as 2 feet/level of the caster due to natural flow. The caster may also choose to end this spell effect at any time, potentially releases the flow of a damned river in a massive flood. -This spell does not allow the caster to raise and lower the level at will during the duration of the spell. -When the spell ends, although any natural buildup of water outside of the spell effect area may rush in, if the water level was raised it does not create a magical flood when the water is released, instead the water subsides back to its original depth without causing mass destruction outside the spell effect area. -The shape of the spell area of effect may also be lengthened into a rectangle up to double the normal dimension, by narrowing the width by a proportional amount, so long as the total area is still the same.

Range: 10 feet  
Duration: 10 minutes / level

If the creature uses poison as an attack, that poison attack will also be nullified for the duration of this spell.

If an object or location, it may be something they have seen directly, or it may be a specific object or location described to them but someone else who is familiar, either they have been to the location or possessed the object. They must be able to describe it in detail or the spell will fail.

If the target is a person or creature, it may get a saving throw ST 21 (WIS/MAGIC). The caster may apply their INT bonus and level bonuses as a penalty on the save. If the target is on a different plane, they get a +5 save. If the caster possesses a part of the target creature, like some hair or fingernail, they get a -5 penalty on their save.

The target loses one level when being raised, and if they are already level 1, they instead lose 2 points of constitution.

Severed limbs will be reattached and broken bones mended, but all the parts must be present. Any part of the body that has been completely destroyed can not be restored. When they are raised, the body is in a weakened state for one day. All their abilities are reduced by 4 points, plus they have -4 on toughness, to hit, and attack power.

**Detect Magic**

**Detect Secret Doors**

**Disguise Self**  
Duration:- 1 hour

Disguise your appearance, clothing and equipment to appear as your choice. You can also appear as a different race but can-t change your height by more than +/- 1 foot. Anyone viewing the disguise can roll ST 24 (WIS/CHARM) to see through the disguise, but they must consciously choose to do so, in other words casual observers would not give you a second thought, but someone looking at you directly would get a check if something seems off or they just get a hunch. The caster's INT modifier is included as a modifier to the ST.

**Feather Fall**  
Range: 30 feet + 5 feet/2 levels

This spell slows the descent of a single creature or object, ensuring that they reach the ground unharmed. When Feather Fall is cast-either up to one minute before a fall or as an immediate reaction while the target is already plummeting-the subject's momentum is arrested. The target drifts to the ground at a swift but safe speed, negating all falling damage. The spell ends moments after the target lands safely, offering reassurance in moments of perilous drops or unexpected falls. Bouncing off of walls or ledges will not stop the spell, the duration continues as long as it takes until the victim has landed safely.

Duration: 1 hour/level

The floating disc is a 3 foot diameter invisible disc which must stay within 40 feet of the caster, that can hold 2 gallons of liquid or 100 pounds of inanimate. This disk floats 3 feet above the ground, but if it goes over a ledge or cliff, it will fall like any normal object, always staying 3 feet above the ground. When the spell ends, or if the disc moves out of range of the caster, for example if falling etc., it will vanish, dropping all contents on the ground. The disc does not need to be pulled, it will follow the caster on it's own at up to 40 feet movement speed, even when moving up stairs or steep incline.

**Glamer**  
Range: 10 feet  
Duration: 24 hours

Glamer creates an illusion on the target, which must be a humanoid, that adds +1 charisma and can make them appear as they did when they were youthful, and if cast on a non human it will make them appear as they would if they were a human, although it will not change their height and build.- So, when cast on a dwarf it makes them appear as a short, very stout human. The glamer spell will not change then height, weight or build of the target, and always makes them appear the same. In other words, it can not be used to disguise someone as another person, or even significantly change their features. It just makes them appear as they would if they were a human. It also changes the appearance of age to be between 20 and 25 years old, but it always changes their features in the same way. IF someone is familiar with the target, they would recognize them, because they appear as the same person, just human, or if they were already human, younger and more attractive.

If the object is magical, the spell reveals its nature, effects, and any command words or activation requirements, giving the caster insight into how to safely use or interact with the item.

**Knock**  
Range: 60 feet

The Knock spell is a magical effect that allows the caster to unlock and open a single object, such as a door, chest, or any locked or secured item, so long as it is within sight. When cast, the spell immediately releases the locking mechanism, causing the object to open or become accessible. If the spell is used on a person who is restrained by chains or manacles, it will free them by unlocking or removing one binding device, but it can only affect a single lock or restraint.

This spell is particularly useful for bypassing obstacles without the need for physical keys or tools. It does not break or damage the object, instead undoing the magical or mechanical lock through arcane means. The spell is limited to unlocking items in the caster's line of sight, although a covering over the object does not count as blocking line of sight.

Range: 1000 feet  
Duration: 10 minutes

When cast the caster can locate any one specific object they know, and have seen, within 1000 feet, or the nearest object of a specific type, like a dagger or healing potion. Once the object is located, if it is moved or moving the caster will know where it is moving too for as long as the duration of the spell. The spell can also be cast on a person or creature, which will allow the caster to track it's movements for the duration of the spell. If the target is not willing, it may ST (21 WIS/MAGIC, subtracting caster's INT bonus) to avoid being tracked. However, if the caster chooses to track an object the target is carrying like a weapon or equipment, no saving throw is allowed.

Range: 40 feet

Creates an enchanted mouth on an inanimate object within range. The caster must specify a specific trigger condition that will cause the mouth to deliver a single spoken message up to 10 minutes in length. The trigger events may be as complex as the caster can specify. The message can not trigger magical effects or cast spells, it is just a spoken message. Once the message is delivered, the magic mouth will vanish. Note the magic mouth trigger can be fooled by illusions, so if for example it was specified to deliver a message to a specific person, if another person disguised as that person enters the area, the mouth will deliver its message.

**Mirror Image**  
Duration: 1 minute / level

Creates 1d4 + caster level mirror images of the caster for the duration of the spell.

Effectively, any attack on the caster forces the attacker to roll at random to attack one of the doubles or the caster. Any successful attack on a mirror image will destroy it, but if the caster is successfully hit, the doubles will all merge through one another and -re randomize- so any enemies still can not distinguish which mirror is the real one.

**Phantasmal Force**  
Range: 60 feet  
Duration: 1 minute

This spell targets a single creature which may roll ST 22 (WIS/MAGIC-ILLUSION, modified by caster's INT). If the ST fails, the target will perceive a phantasmal object of the caster's choice.

The creature can even attack or harm the target, using normal combat rules, although any damage caused will be at most 1 AP per level of the caster.  
  

**Read Thoughts (ESP)  
**Range: 30 feet  
Duration: 1 minute  
Material components: a copper penny

The Read Thoughts spell enables the caster to sense and interpret the thoughts of any creature within 30 feet for up to 1 minute. The spell can be used in two main ways: simply detecting the presence of thinking creatures within 30 feet, or actively probing the mind of a particular target. Surface thoughts'such as what the target is currently thinking-can be accessed instantly and without the target's awareness or a saving throw. If the victim is asked an innocent question in this way, their thoughts on the answer will rise to the surface of their mind, and the true answer, along with if the target is lying or tell the truth, can be read without them becoming aware that they have been.

If the caster tries to probe deeper into the target's memories or more private thoughts, the target gets to roll ST 18 (WIS/MAGIC), adding the magic user's WIS modifier as well. If successful, the deeper thoughts remain protected and the target becomes aware their mind is being read. If the save fails however, the magic user may continue to probe their thoughts and memories without them becoming aware. The victim gets another save for each memory the magic user attempts to retrieve. -This makes the spell a powerful tool for both detection and interrogation, with subtle risks for the target if the caster presses for more information.

The caster may also use there telepathic link to see and hear what the dominated person is seeing and hearing, as long as they concentrate on doing so. Once a command is given, the target must follow that command, as if it were there own decision to do whatever they were commanded to do, within limits of their abilities. For example, they must still sleep and eat, etc. but otherwise they will continue to follow the command. The caster may issue a new command whenever they chose, although that requires on full round of action, as if they were casting a new spell. The target may attempt a new save roll again each day, but only if and when the caster gives them a new command. They do not get another chance to save so long as they continue to follow their original command.

**Extended Flight**  
Duration: 1 hour per level

This spell allows the caster to fly at a movement speed of 40 feet, or a sustained speed of 8 miles per hour for the duration of the spell without rest. So a 10th level magic user could cover 80 miles in 10 hours. The caster can not fly if heavily encumbered, but can fly at a reduced speed of 30 feet / 6 miles per hour if moderately encumbered (up to 2x base encumbrance amount). -When flying long distances the caster my fly at an altitude up to a couple thousand feet, any higher the winds would be too strong to allow the caster to make headway, although if they want to be carried along with the prevailing winds they are only limited by oxygen and weather. If they are protected from the cold the practical limit is about 10,000 feet.

**Hold Monster**  
Range: 60 feet  
Duration: 1 minute

One creature must ST 20 (WIS/MAGIC) (subtract caster's INT bonus) or be held fast for 1 minute, unable to move, attack, or cast spells. The victim may speak normally while held. This is similar to hold person, except it can affect any target, humanoid or otherwise.

**Magic Jar**  
Range: 100 feet + 10 feet per level  
Duration: 1 hour per level

This spell transfers the caster's soul into a gem or large crystal, called the magic jar, for the duration of the spell. While the spell is in effect, the caster's body enters a state of suspended animation. The magic jar must be within range to cast the spell. Once in the jar, the caster may reach out and attack any sentient creature within 10 feet per level, in order to possess their body. However, while in the jar the caster can only sense how powerful any nearby targets are, within about 4 levels, and if it is good or evil. However, when the caster attempts to possess a nearby body, the actual target is chosen randomly from any living creature in range.

When the caster chooses to possess a body, the target can save ST 23 (WIS/MAGIC, minus caster INT). If the target is protected by protection from magic or protection from evil, the attack will fail. -If the save is successful, the caster returns to the jar and further attempts to possess the same target will fail.

If the caster successfully possesses its target, the target's soul becomes trapped in the jar and the caster will control its body. The body retains its strength, dexterity, constitution and any natural attacks. The caster retains their spell abilities, intelligence, wisdom, and charisma. The caster can not use any spells from the body it possesses, but it can use magical attacks, for example a gaze attack.

If the body is killed, the caster's soul returns either to the magic jar, or its own body, whichever is in range, and if neither is in range the caster dies. The caster may choose to either return to the magic jar or their own body at any time, if in range, and at that time they will release the victim's soul back into its own body, again if the magic jar is in range. If it is not in range the victim will die.

If the spell ends and the caster is not in range of their own body, they will die.

**Mislead**  
Duration: 1 round per level

This spell makes the caster invisible, and at the same time creates an illusory double of the caster. The caster is free to go elsewhere while the double does something else. The double illusion includes audible illusions as well, so it can speak or make natural noises. The caster may make the illusion react if it is hit to preserve the illusion, otherwise it will be obvious it is an illusion, and the illusion can not be extended to other objects for example to appear to pick something up, and obviously cant move physical objects.

**Modify Memory**  
Range: 25 feet + 2 feet per level

The caster can modify a memory of up to 5 minutes for the target if they fail to ST 22 (WIS/MAGIC), the caster may use their INT modifier as a penalty on the save, plus level bonuses. The caster may remove a memory of events which occurred, add a memory of events which never happened, modify a memory in some way, or enhance a memory so the target has perfect recall of those events. The caster must concentrate on implanting or modifying the memory for 5 minutes undisturbed, and if they are disturbed by being attacked mor moved the spell will fail. After having a memory modified, the target will have no memory of being subjected to the spell, or anything that happened during the time while they were having their memory changed.

**Passwall**  
Duration: 1 hour per level  
Area of Effect: 8 foot x 8 foot x 2 feet deep / level

This spell creates a magical passage through earth, wood or stone, but can not pass through metal. The caster may dismiss the spell at any time. Anyone inside the passage when it closes will be pushed out either end. The passage is magical so it can not collapse while the spell is in effect.

**Poison Cloud**  
Range: 120 feet  
Area of effect: 20 foot radius sphere  
Duration: 10 minutes

This spell creates a thick fog of noxious poison gas that can kill on contact in a 20 foot radius sphere. All creatures entering or remaining in the cloud will receive poison damage equal to an attack power 15 attack, which ignores armor. The cloud will persist for 10 minutes, and can be moved up to 10 feet per minute by the caster in whatever direction they choose. The poisonous cloud kills on contact, so even creatures which don-t breath can still be poisoned.

**Telekinesis**  
Range: 60 feet  
Duration: 10 minutes

For the duration of this spell, the caster may move any object they can see within range up to 1000 pounds. The object may be moved up to 30 feet per round. You can also use this ability to manipulate objects, like to open a chest or a door. If the target is able to grasp something they can pull against the force, but the force is equivalent to up to 1000 pounds, so only a creature able to lift more than 1000 pounds would be able to resist. Likewise, a creature could attempt to hold on to something to avoid being moved by this spell, but it would be equivalent to holding on to hanging on to something while carrying 1000 pounds, something that can be done only if they have a good grip. In this cast, the target may roll DT 23 (STR), but in this case the caster's INT ability and level bonuses can not be added, its just a test if the target is strong enough to hold to something against a force of 1000 pounds.

**Telepathic Link**  
Range: 30 feet  
Duration: 1 hour

The caster may select up to 6 willing targets within range, forming a telepathic link between the targets. For the duration of the spell, all the targets may communicate willingly with each other telepathically. This does not allow the targets to read thoughts unless willingly shared by another, but it does allow a target to share complete memories as they recall them. It also allows the communication link to be with one or more individuals in the group, or with the entire group at once. The link extends over any distance. Also, the target's do not need to speak the same language. They can communicate thoughts and intentions clearly regardless of language, or be able to understand others from a recalled memory as if the person who is recalling the memory can understand them. Even if the person who's memory is being shared could not understand the languages in a memory, if others in the telepathic link can, they will be able to understand the spoken language form the recalled memory.

**Wall of Force**  
Range: 120 feet  
Duration: 10 minutes

Creates an invisible wall of force, either in a sphere up to 10 feet in radius, or in any combination of up to 10 10 foot by 10 foot (or smaller) flat panels oriented any way the caster wants, as long as they are contiguous. The wall of force is impenetrable, immune to all physical damage, and cant be dispelled by dispel magic, but it can be disintegrated. -When the spell is cast, it will irresistibly push any creatures physically intersecting the wall out of the way, and can not be used to cut them in half or trap them intersecting the wall.

**Wall of Stone**  
Range: 120 feet

Creates a wall of stone in any combination of up to 10 10 foot by 10 foot (or smaller) panels, 6 inches thick, oriented any way the caster wants, as long as they are contiguous. Each panel may be curved naturally up to 90 degrees, and can have openings like doors or windows. The spell can not be created where an object or creature is standing. -The wall appears immediately, but if the caster continues to concentrate on the spell and takes no other action for 10 minutes, the wall becomes permanent, natural stone. The stone is as hard as stone formed from lava in a single piece, but if not constructed properly, it may collapse under its own weight. It has the physical characteristics of normal granite.

After a successful attack which causes a minor wound or greater, the victim must ST 16 (DEX) -or become grabbed by the worm. If the worm is successful, it will drag its victim back into its tunnel. Because of the confined space, the victim will be unable to move or attack, as the worm continues to crush its victim with it's powerful mandibles. Each subsequent attack will automatically hit and have the same AP 8. While being held, the victim may continue to struggle to break free with ST 21 (STR), although once free they still have to crawl out of the tunnel to escape and 50% movement speed. The tunnel worm normally only drags the victim about 10-20 feet into it's tunnel. Other party members may attempt to crawl into the tunnel to help break the victim free.

The victim must be size M or smaller, L or larger monsters are too large to be carried by the eagle. IF the victim fails the saving throw, the eagle will carry them up into the sky for 1d6 combat rounds, and then drop them. The victim can again roll ST 24 (con) or be crushed to death from the fall. A successful save results instead in a major wound, as the victim has managed to land on some object to break their fall.

Eagles wont normally attack human prey unless under exceptional circumstances. They normally hunt fish, dear or other wild animals.

**Giant Centipede**

Level: 8

Movement Speed: 40  
Size: XL  
Alignment: neutral  
Special ability: Poison ST 21 (CON/POISON)  
XP Value: 1488

Giant centipedes are huge insects with 21 body segments, plus one head segment. Because each body segment has its own heart and nervous system, attacks are most effective on the head, which has both the eyes and mandibles. You can literally cut a centipede in half and both halves will continue fighting, although only the front part can see. Sections which no longer can see will thrash around for a few rounds and then lie still, slowly dying. Even if the head segment receives a mortal wound, other body segments can continue to move around, although without being able to see it will not be able to direct movement in any particular direction. If 4 or more body segments are incapacitated with major wounds or worse, the entire centipede movement will be reduced by 50%

Of course all the segments are connected, and the head can neither move nor attack without at least the first 2 body segments being functional. For that reason, the effects of any major or minor wounds on either of the first two body segments will also affect the head. In other words, if the first or second body segment receive a minor or major wound, the same penalties from that wound apply to the head segment as well.

The centipede attacks with a bite from mandibles located on the head segment. If a victim receives a minor wound or worse, they mays also save against poison ST 21 (CON/POISON) or be paralyzed after 1d4 combat rounds.

**Giant Snake**

Level: 7  
Toughness: 14 + 3 (natural armor)  
Attack Power: 7  
Hit Bonus: 4  
Dodge Bonus: 0  
Movement Speed: 30  
Size: XL  
Alignment: neutral  
Special ability:- Constriction.  
XP Value: 830

A full grown giant snake is generally 50-60 feet long, and attacks humans like smaller constrictors attack mice.

A giant snake will first attack with its bite, and if it gets a minor wound or better, it will begin to constrict the victim. Initially the victim can ST (STR) 21 to break free. But, for each subsequent round the snake will begin constricting, which is an attack with an automatic hit and AP starting at 5, and ignores target armor. Each round the victim can try to break free again, but the ST goes up by 2 for each round, to a maximum of ST (STR) 41. The AP also goes up by 2 each round, to a maximum of AP 25. The victims toughness will also be reduced by 1 for each round of constriction as they suffocate.

Obviously, once a victim is captured and begins to be constricted, they are unable to move or do anything other then try, if they can, to break free. However, while constricting one victim in its coils, the snake may continue to strike at other opponents with its bite, although it can only constrict one victim at a time.

While this happens, each metal item the carry, except items made of gold, mithril or magic items, must ST 14 (ACID) or be destroyed by the acid. While the target is being engulfed (for 1d6 rounds), each round they can roll DC 19 (STR) to free themselves. Any other characters may also help pull them out and add their own STR modifier to the roll. Each round they will take an attack AP 5 of acid burns. If they do not escape, once they are engulfed the victim will take an attack AP 15 of acid damage each turn until it is digested.

The cube is only large enough to hold 1 L victim or 4 M or smaller at a time. Once it is full, it can not ingest new victims for a week, after which it will be large enough to undergo mitosis and divide into 2 new cubes.

IT moves very slowly, and prefers to hide in shadows on the ceiling, The slime is blind but can sense vibrations and also detect odors. If a victim is below the slime, it will drop on top of them to launch a surprise attack. The slime can either attack with a club like pseudo pod (AP 3) or if it manages to envelope or drop onto a victim from above, it attacks with acid, also at AP 3. If the victim either steps on or falls into the slime or the slime drops on them from above, the acid attack does not need a to hit roll, it is continuous acid damage. In such a case, the slime can be removed with oil, alcohol, or water, although this s difficult and will take 2d12 rounds to escape from the slime in this way, and they must have either a large source of water or other solvent in order to do this. When the slime attacks with s pseudo pod, a successful hit will result in an appendage wrapped around it's victim. The slime will then slither up the appendage until it envelope's the victim, unless the victim moves away. They must remain within 10 feet of the slime in order for the attack to continue in this way. Although the slime is immune from weapon damage, it is vulnerable to fire, cold, lightning. The easiest way to deal with a slime is with burning oil, but this may be complicated if the slime has attacked a member of the party and is already on top of them.

A Litch is a wraith formed by a high level magic user who performed a special ritual to transform themselves into a litch before they died. Undead do not retain the spell casting ability or any skills or memories form their living selves, but If a magic user is cursed by a wraith to become a wraith, and they perform a special ritual after they have been mortally wounded but before they die, they are able to transform into an undead litch without actually dying. The litch's existence is in limbo between living and dead. Certainly more undead than alive, the litch retains all the spell casting ability of a 9th level magic user, in addition to the formidable powers of a wraith. Furthermore, the litch retains its memories of its living self, although over thousands of years they may fade. But, somewhere inside the litch remains the soul of the person they once were. Why someone would wish to do this to themselves on purpose is unfathomable. Only the pursuit of immortality of undeath could persuade a truly evil magic user to undertake such a horrific transformation.

One favorite spell the a litch may employ to further preserve their undeath is magic jar. When using a magic jar, a litch can possess the body of another wraith, using it as s ort of disposable undead meat shield, being able to exercise all their own litch abilities through the wraith, as well as retaining their own spell casting ability. Thus, when slain in this way, the litch's undead soul is returned to the magic jar, so long as it is kept withing 100 feet. For this reason the Litch will often reside in a well defended fortress, close to its own magic jar and original litch's body in case the wraith it possesses is ever killed.

If a litch dies for any reason, they will still rise again, but as a normal wraith, losing all their spell casting abilities, but still cursed to haunt the world of the living in a state of undeath for eternity.

Fauns generally prefer to live alone or with one or two companions in a small, simple cottage in the wilderness. They avoid large settlements and shun humans, but can sometimes be found in the company of elves with whom they have a natural affinity.

Fauns enjoy wine. They often have a small garden near their cottages and forage for nuts and wild fruit in the forest. They do not eat meat, but they may have a goat or two and make some of the finest wine and cheese that can be found. Fauns also have expert knowledge of medicinal and magical herbs and cultivate rare and hard to find herbs in their gardens.

Attack Power: 15 (club)  
Hit Bonus: 3  
Dodge Bonus: 0  
Movement Speed: 40  
Size: XL  
Alignment: chaotic  
XP Value:

Giants are immense, brutish monsters. -Giants may be encountered with one or two eyes and sometimes with two heads. Whether a giant has one eye or two, or even multiple heads, their aggressive tendencies and fighting style remain largely the same. They are not typically known for their intelligence, but can be cunning, especially when stalking an opponent or seeking out a victim. Giants favor attacking with a colossal club, preferring their victims to hold still to make the smashing easier.

**Gnome**

Attack Power: 3 (short bow or short spear)  
Hit Bonus: 0  
Dodge Bonus: 2

XP Value:

Gnomes are small, short legged and round bellied creatures who live in forest, hills, or caves. Gnomes live in small villages and shun people, although they often associate with elves and other woodland species. Gnomes are also miners and may form relationships with dwarves as well.

Being small, they will avoid combat if they can, but if pressed they can fight with small bows or spears. They are very skilled at avoiding detections, and have a natural skill to hide in shadows or move silently like a 2nd level thief. IF they don-t want to be seen, you often will not see them at all.

**Goblin**  
Level: 1  
Toughness: 3 + 2 (leather armor)

Goblins are fairy creatures closely related to elves, although they tend to be favor chaos. Goblins have a natural affinity for darkness. Like elves, goblins do not naturally age and may live for thousands of years. Goblins tend to sleep for thousands of years, locked away from surface in caverns deep beneath the surface, waiting only to be disturbed from their slumber. The goblins that have awoken are a terrible plague on the other races who dwell on the surface. Were they all to be awoken at once, they would unleash a horde so mighty they would surely destroy the entire world.

Goblins have a very wide natural variation in intelligence. Most are quite stupid and easily tricked in many ways, but a few are very clever, on par with even the most intelligent human. The more clever goblins tend to become leaders, although goblins naturally have a terrible time of self organization. They are selfish and lack any concept of honor or respect, so leadership is limited to following another goblin who seems to make better decisions as an exercise in self interest, to preserve their own hide.-

All goblins can cast spells, although most very poorly. Any group of 5 or more goblins has a 50% chance to have at least one spell caster amongst the. -The most commonly learned spells are charm person, sleep, or glamor. Goblins do have a special affinity for the glamor spell, and when a goblin spell caster casts glamor, the duration is extended to 24 hours. Its not uncommon to find a goblin spell caster or witch who has cast glamor to appear as a beautiful young maiden, and in this way deceive an adventurer to gain an advantage. They have even been known to infiltrate human villages using glamor to pose as a normal human, only to let their comrades in during the dark of night to raid the village.

**Gremlin**  
Level: 1  
Toughness: 2  
Attack Power: 3 (dagger)  
Hit Bonus: 0  
Dodge Bonus: 2  
Movement Speed: 20  
Size: S  
Alignment: chaotic  
XP Value:

Gremlins are small fairy creatures, similar but smaller than their larger cousins the goblins. What they lack in size (and intelligence) they make up for in enthusiasm for wreaking havoc. Like goblins, gremlins have a lot of natural variation in intelligence. More than half only speak with grunts and gestures. But, a small number of them are at least as intelligent as an average person. Those that do speak speak a common goblin language. They also have natural spell casting ability, but like goblins most of them are very bad at it. Fewer than 10% have any spell casting ability and will use a sleep spell.

**Hobgoblin**  
Level: 3  
Toughness: 7 + 3 (scale armor)  
Attack Power: 8 (scimitar)  
Hit Bonus: 1  
Dodge Bonus: 1 + 3 (shield)  
Movement Speed: 30  
Size: M  
Alignment: chaotic  
XP Value:

Hobgoblins are larger and more deadly monsters than their smaller cousins the goblins. But, in many ways they are virtually the same. The biggest difference is those hobgoblins who do have increased spell affinity have more potent spells to choose from. They can cast 2x 1st level and 1x 2nd level magic user spells per day. They usually use sleep, charm, and glamor for 1st level and hold person for 2nd.

**Lizard Man**  
Level: 1  
Toughness: 3 + 2 (leather armor)  
Attack Power: 4 (scimitar)  
Hit Bonus: 0  
Dodge Bonus: 3 (shield)  
Movement Speed: 30  
Size: M  
Alignment: neutral  
XP Value: 15

Lizard men are brutish, bipedal humanoid lizards. Their intelligence is limited but sufficient to make simple weapons and build crude dwellings. They have their own simple language which only they speak, but often communicate with gestures and grunts. They may live in caves or burrows and prefer to live near a river, lake or swamp. They sometimes build a defensive berm and palisade around their dwellings if it is a large group. Lizard Man villages are usually small and led by the largest and most physically powerful individual. Leadership can change when another lizard man challenges the current leader.

Although lizard men are less intelligent than humans, they are significantly tougher and stronger because of their reptilian anatomy. They are also excellent swimmers. They can-t breath underwater but because of their cold blooded metabolism they may stay submerged for up to an hour in a semi dormant state, and can swim freely for up to 15 minutes without needed to come to the surface to breath.- -

**Ogre 9**  
Level: 9  
Toughness: 19 + 3 (natural armor)  
Attack Power: 13 (club)  
Hit Bonus: 4  
Dodge Bonus: 0  
Movement Speed: 30  
Size: XL  
Alignment: chaotic  
XP Value: 15

Ogres actually are very distant relatives of goblins. Although MOST ogres are quite stupid and barely speak, those that do speak speak a common ogre dialect which is a version of goblin, close enough that anyone who speaks goblin can easily understand ogre and communicate in that language.

Although very rare, some ogres do have normal human intelligence, and can even converse in both goblin, ogre, and common. And a rarer few, like all goblinoids, have advanced spell casting ability. In most cases this is limited to the ability of a hobgoblin, but as ogres are also ageless, some very old (and intelligent) ogres have advanced spell casting abilities, even up to the level of a 9th level wizard. This, fortunately, is almost unheard of, as a 2000 year old 9th level ogre spell caster is a truly fearsome opponent.

**Satyr 2**  
Level: 2  
Toughness: 5 + 2 (natural armor)  
Attack Power: 6 (spear or bow)  
Hit Bonus: 1  
Dodge Bonus: 1  
Movement Speed: 30  
Size: M  
Alignment: neutral  
XP Value:

A Satyr has the torso and head of a human and legs and horns of a goat,- In some ways similar to a faun, the satyr is much stockier in build and wilder in temperament. It gets more of its personality from a billy goat and less from a human. When they fight, a satyr will use a spear or long bow. Although wild, satyr's love wine above all else and also music and poetry. They love nature and wild beasts, who will never attack a satyr unless provoked. Satyr's do not make dwellings, but make there homes unsheltered in the wild.

**Troll**  
Level: 5  
Toughness: 11 + 3 (scale armor)  
Attack Power: 10 (scimitar)  
Hit Bonus: 2  
Dodge Bonus: 2 + 3 (shield)  
Movement Speed: 30  
Size: L  
Alignment: chaotic  
XP Value:

Trolls are closely related to their smaller cousins goblins and hobgoblins, so closely that they share a common language. Like goblins, trolls have a wide variation in intelligence and magical ability. Most are brutish and ignorant, but some trolls are more clever. Being larger and more powerful than humans, trolls, especially the more intelligent ones, gain amusement from toying with them. Trolls love riddles and clever games, and nothing amuses them more than to confound a human with a puzzle and then destroy them as punishment for their arrogance and ignorance, usually with their death.

Trolls who have the ability to cast spells can utilize magic user spells up to 3rd level. If they have the ability, the troll may cast 3 1st level spells, 2 2nd and one 3rd level spell each day. They prefer the spells sleep, charm person, glamor, hold person, invisibility, curse and fear. --

**War Troll 7**  
Level: 7  
Toughness: 15 + 3 (scale armor)  
Attack Power: 14 (greataxe or greatsword)  
Hit Bonus: 3  
Dodge Bonus: 3  
Movement Speed: 30  
Size: XL  
Alignment: chaotic  
XP Value:

Although war trolls are related to their smaller cousins goblins, hobgoblins and trolls, their larger size and power comes with a diminished intellect. War trolls are uniformly brutish and can only speak or understand a few words in the goblin tounge. They have none of the magical ability of other goblinoids. They generally fight with two handed weapons, either a two handed axe or sword.

## Dragons

Dragons are ancient, intelligent, and powerful creatures that have existed since the dawn of time. Legends speak of their vast size, fearsome might, and magical prowess, making them the most dreaded of all monsters. Dragons also speak common and dragon, a unique language known only to other dragons. Dragons are not only formidable in battle but are also cunning strategists, making them dangerous adversaries and awe-inspiring beings in myth and story.

Dragons greed and love of flattery can often be their Achilles Heel. For such intelligent creatures, it can be surprising how easily they are distracted by either gold or profuse flattery. When all else fails, try complimenting the dragon's immense power and awe inspiring might.

Because of their exceptional greed and love for gold, dragons will always have treasure in a dragon horde. Roll for treasure on the random treasure table at 2 levels above the dragon's level. Double the number of gems and jewelry found, and 10x the amount of gold pieces. Convert all coins from other denominations into gold first. Also, the DC for magic items will always succeed, and the dragon will have twice the number of magic items normally indicated. When encountered in the wild, they will always have a lair nearby, but because they are such large creatures, the lair may be up to 10 or 20 miles away when encountered. So, for random encounters, roll 1d2. 1 indicates the party has stumbled upon the dragon in its lair, 2 means the dragon has been encountered while wandering. If wandering, roll 2d12 to determine how many miles away the lair is. Sometimes there may be a faint plume of smoke emanating from the lair which can be seen some miles away, and there will always be a powerful odor of sulfur near the lair.

All dragons breathe fire, a devastating attack that can only be used 3 times per day.

## Unique

The world is filled with a myriad unique and diverse monsters of all kinds. Many situations call for a unique, bespoke class of monster. If you find a need for a unique monster class, you can create a new class of monster to fit the situation.

**Base**

Level: 1  
Toughness: 2 + 2 (natural armor)  
Attack Power: 4  
Hit Bonus: 0  
Dodge Bonus: 0

Basse toughness starts at 2, and for each level increase, toughness goes up by +2. Monsters also get a base toughness bonus for any armor, or natural armor in the case of beasts and many mythical creatures. Creatures with natural armor may have up to a +10 armor bonus for natural armor, +10 being equivalent to full plate armor.

Attack power starts at 4, to be more or less in line with a standard melee weapon like a spear or shortsword, and increases by +1 every level. To hit bonus and dodge bonus both go up by +1 for every 2 levels, starting at level 2. So, level 2 monsters have a to hit and dodge bonus of +1, +2 at level 4, etc.

Once the base stats have been defined, you should adjust those stats to match the characteristics of the creature. A large and lumbering monster may have increase toughness and attack power by +1, while decreasing the hit bonus and Dodge Bonus by -1. Or, the creature may have multiple attacks, but each attack would have a reduced attack power. To keep the creature's difficulty aligned with the base level, each additional ability, extra attack or attack bonus should be balanced with an equal reduction to some other combat characteristic, so that the creature remains balanced at the desired level of difficulty. If you want to have a creature with many attacks and abilities, but you dont want the attacks to be reduced in power, start with a HIGHER creature level, so that after applying modifiers for each additional attack or ability, you still have a fairly balanced creature.

For example, lets say you start with a creature at level 5, so the base toughness, attack power, hit bonus and Dodge Bonus are all 7. Lets say you want to give the creature 2 attacks, so you need to either would reduce hit chance and attack power to 6 or reduce the creature's toughness and Dodge Bonus to 6 to keep the difficulty balanced at level 5. But, if you dont want to reduce any of these.- If thats the case, START at level 6, with attack power, etc. all at 8, then add the second attack but bring attack power and hit bonus back down to 7 (the same as at level 5). Although, now the toughness and evasions bonus are still 8, so you can either trade off a little bit of attack power for toughness, or a little bit of Dodge Bonus for a hit bonus, but either way you would have a well balanced level 6 monster with dual attacks instead of a level 5 monster with two weaker attacks.

# Appendix A - D20 System

There are many different fantasy role playing games built on the D20 system, which was meant to be interchangeable between game systems.  As long as a game is based on hit points and a d20, it should be easy to share content between games.  So much content has been created in the various D20 game systems, Treasures and Trolls was designed to make it as easy as possible to convert content, monsters, spells, items, or even whole adventure moduels across T&T and D20 games.  For that reason, these rules have been created to help convert from one system to the other.  Converting d20 to T&T is meant to be as close to a 1-1 conversion as possible.

- **To hit, dice checks, saving throws and other rolls:**  To hit rolls and other dice checks use a straight 1:1 conversion. So, a +1 modifier for to hit, saving throws, or other dice checks are +1 in T&T. However, the median roll in a T&T basic roll is 16, compared to 10 in D20 rolls. So, add +6 to any D20 DC check to convert to T&T, and subtract 6 to convert from T&T to D20. So, a DC 16 in T&T requires a 10 on D20, and a dice check of 10 in D2 would require DC 16 in T&T.

- **Attack damage:** Just like to hit, attack damage is convert 1:1 into T&T attack power. However, most attack damage in D20 is based on a dice roll. So, convert the median dice roll into attack power in T&T. For example, a long sword does 1d8 damage, and the median is 4.5. So, you have to round up to 5 attack power. 2d8 would be 9 AP. Weapon damage bonuses are also converted 1:! into T&T, so a +1 damage bonus in D20 is +1 AP in T&T.

- **Hit points:** Hit points need a special conversion because T&T does not use hit point based damage. However, the effect of hit points can be converted based on the number of times you would need to hit an opponent with a certain number of hit points to bring it down to 0 hp. The simple answer is each monster level is with 1d8 hit points is equivalent to a T&T toughness of 2. So, an opponent with 5d8 hit points would be a toughness of 10 in T&T. The way this works is based on hitting an opponent with a typical weapon that does 1d8 damage. If the opponent has 1d8 hit points, you would have a 50% chance to bring it to 0hp in 1 hit. If it had 2d8 hit points, there would be a 50% chance after 2 hits, etc. You can compare this to the odds of scoring a serious or mortal wound using a similar AP weapon in T&T, after X number of attacks. The conversion is not exact, because you are comparing statistical probabilities to an actual hit point counter in a D20 system, but the result is each additional 1d8 hit points for an opponent would increase the toughness by about +2. Also, items which grant bonus hit points would be converted based on +2 toughness for every 4.5 hp. This is also why a fighter class gets +2 toughness bonus per level, equivalent more or less to a 1d8 hit dice for D20. Again, this is a rough conversion since some D20 rule systems use d10 or eve d12 hit dice for combat classes, but that is meant for play balancing. This would be equivalent to a T&T class which gets a higher toughness bonus per level, maybe +3 or even +4. However, because hit points don’t accumulate the same way in T&T, having a character class with 3 or 4 toughness bonus per level would be badly unbalanced, because their toughness would quickly scale to the point where it would be nearly impossible to wound them. The problem is that in D20, if you have an opponent with a lot of hit points, you can just wear them down 1 ho at a time. But, in T&T, if the toughness becomes excessive compared to attack power, it becomes virtually impossible to score any damage at all. So, you can't just wear them down little by little. This happens about level 8 or 9, around a toughness modifier of 16-18. This is intentional, because the T&T combat system was designed such that you cant just wear your opponent down 1 hp at a time, and most combat classes scale up attack power with level, unlike D20 where weapon damage does not scale with levels.
