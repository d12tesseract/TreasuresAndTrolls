# Introduction
This campaign is an example of how to use the basic or advanced Treasures and Trolls guides to create and adventure campaign.  It includes examples of how to customize the rules to fit the narrative of a story.  Every campaing needs some context about the world it is set in and some background about that world.  The amount of background lore created for the campagin depends on how much story background is needed. Enough detail should be included to fill out the story of the campaign, but not aso much it becomes a burden to the story telling.  At some point every campaing neeeds to tell a story, whihc is a balance between the background lore of the world the campaign is set in, and the details of the adventure modules that tell the story.  Creating the right amount of bacground details to support the adventure modules creates realism for the story, helps the players understand the wolrd the adventure is set in, and cam help embelish the adventure with context.

This campaign is set in the world of Ur, a world of many races and cultures.

# Astrology
The world of Ur has 4 planets, two inner planets which appear low on the horizon either after sunset of berfore dawn, and two outer planets which can appear anywhere in the night sky, and always appear in opposition (directly overhead at midnight) once per year.

# Calendar
The Elven Urish Calendar is the standard calendar used by most Urish cultures.  It is a Lunar calendar based on both the annual seasons marked by the solstices and equnioxes and the progression of the moon's phases.

Each month begins on the first day after the appearance of the new moon, and lasts until the moon wanes and becomes new again.  The new year begins the day after the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year.

Because of the relative lengths of the solar year and the lunar month, the Elven calendar is made up of a repeating cycle called a centarch of 110 years, 1,392 months and 39,306 days, which repeats when the new moon occurs on the same day as the winter solstice, so that the new month and new year begin on the same day.  These celestial periods result ina  month which is either 28 or 29 days long and a year that has 357 or 358 days, depending on the exact timing of both the new moon and the winter solstice.

Each month always begins on monday, and has 4 7 day weeks.  If the month has 29 days the last day of the month is called "Ursday", so that the following month can beign on a Monday.  Because the Urish month is about 28 1/4 days on average, this occurs about every 4 months.  The 29th day in a month (Ursday) is usually celebrated as a festival.  Depending on the time of year, it is either the Spring festival (1st festival in the year), Planting festival (always before summer solstice), Harvest festival (1st festival after summer solstice), and the Yule festival, whihc celebrates the coming begining of a new year and (eventually) return of summer and spring.  The Yule festival is always celebrated for the 12 days leading up to the festivasl day (on the last day of the month) Because not every year has 4 Ursday's, Yule will be celebrated on the first new moon after the winter solstice.  In the rare case where the first new moon adter the winter solstice is on a 29 day month, the spring, planting and harvest festivals will all heppen one cycle later than ususal, although the planting festival must always come before the summer solstice and harvbest festival is always the first Ursday after the summer solstice.

Each year may have 12 or 13 months, depending again on the timing of the winter solstice and the new moon.  Each 110 year centarch is divided into 5 22 year lunar cycles of 12 or 13 month years, which repeat 5 times each centarch, where roughly 2 years with 13 months for every 1 with only 12.

Each month is named after the atrologicasl constelation in which roughly the full moon will apear, although this is an apporximation at best because the size of each constellaion in the night sky is far from uniform.
