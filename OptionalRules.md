### Alignment
Character alignment can apply to an individual or also monster species.  Alignment determines the moral choices a character will make.  Alignment iis made up of two dimensions, law and chaos and good and evil.

**Law/Chaos:**

- Lawful – Law and order form the foundation of civilization.  It is built on the assumption that individuals respect the rights of others in society, including the right to personal property and the right to be treated justly under laws applied equally to all. Without this foundation, civilization can not stand. The idea of honor is fundamental to the lawful alignment.  Those who have honor and are committed to defend rights of others, weak or powerful alike, are lawful in alignment.
- Chaotic – Chaos is the opposite of a lawful alignment.  Individuals aligned with chaos reject the fundamental idea of individual rights or equality.  For those aligned with chaos, might makes right.  Individuals can and should take what they want by force.  It is the law of the jungle. Not only do chaotic individuals have no honor, they reject the idea of honor.  Honor and justice are for suckers.
- Neutral – Neutral individuals exist between the two extremes of law and chaos.  There is a place for honor and justice, just as there is a place for enlightened self interest. A truly neutral alignment places value in flexibility above rigidity.  To make the right decision but to acknowledge that the circumstances may call for both law and order or at times to make exceptions to those laws.

**Good/Evil:**

 - Good – good creatures follow a path of good and righteous actions, to eliminate suffering in the world.  To further those ends, good creatures will follow the golden rule and pursue a course of action that benefits as many deserving individuals in the most beneficial way possible.
 - Evil – the opposite of good, evil creatures seek to cause suffering whenever possible.  Pure evil is the pursuit of suffering as and end unto itself, to find a course of action that harms as many individuals as possible and causes the maximum suffering.
 - Neutral – with respect to good and evil, a neutral position is to neither cause suffering nor alleviate it.  This encompasses a very wide range of behavior from enlightened self interest to the law of the jungle.  There is a very wide gray area between good and evil.  Very few creatures actively pursue truly pure evil and likewise few are purely good.  Many exists in the gray area in between, at times being good, others tending to selfishness and even evil actions.  Even moral judgements can be difficult.  Consider a wild animal like a wolf.  Wolves are not evil, yet their existence depends on hunting and killing other prey species which did nothing to deserve their fate, and in fact cause them great suffering.  But, this is in the wolf’s nature, so it is neither evil nor good.  It can only exist in the role nature has made for it.  When intelligent creatures who can make enlightened judgements do such things, are they evil?  Is it wrong for a farmer to raise animals for the purpose of slaughtering them?  Is that an act of evil?  Very few choices can be made that are purely good or purely evil.

#### Ethos

In addition to the core alignment, individuals or groups of individuals share different ethos.  These values are reflected in their behavior and what behaviors they see as admirable in others.  Both social groups and creature types may express one or more of these characteristics as part of their ethos.  This can be used when describing the ethos of a kingdom or nation, a racial type, or a creature’s behavior, as a refinement of alignment into a more finely tuned description.  By describing the ethos of a creature or racial type, the TM can easily create a baseline of how they are going to react to a player’s actions.
 - Ahisma – the belief that all life is sacred and no enlightened individual should cause harm to any living creature in any way.  This ethos excepts animals from this expectation because it is in their nature, for example, for a predator to take the life of its prey.  Humans are enlightened and because they are enlightened can not ignore the conclusion that causing harm to another living creature is wrong.  This ethos also accepts that most people do not have the conviction to follow this path, but as they pursue enlightenment, they can only come to the inescapable conclusion that ahisma is the only enlightened path.  This is why so few people achieve true enlightenment.
 - Allegiance - loyalty and obedience to a ruler takes precedence over all other duties or personal interests.  The highest virtue is to serve and honor one’s ruler or master, placing their commands, well-being, and legacy above individual safety and security.
 - Classism - there is a natural order to society, where every individual has a predetermined place. People are expected to accept their position within the hierarchy, defer to those above them, and exercise authority or privilege over those below.
 - Compassion - genuine care for the suffering and well-being of others is a fundamental guiding principle.  Belief in empathy, kindness, and the desire to alleviate hardship. Individuals strive to understand the feelings and needs of others and act to reduce suffering whenever possible.
 - Courage - fearing nothing, even when facing mortal danger.  True strength lies in the willingness to confront threats, adversity, or pain without hesitation. Individuals are expected to endure suffering, overcome pain, and act bravely regardless of the risks involved.
 - Dominance - power, strength, and the ability to prevail in direct confrontation are the ultimate sources of authority and legitimacy. Those who are strongest—physically, socially, or politically—are entitled to rule or make decisions, and disputes should be settled through combat rather than negotiation or consensus.
 - Greed - the belief that the accumulation of material possessions is the ultimate goal.  Personal gain, possession, and enrichment are valued above all else, at the expense of fairness or the interests of others.  Money, resources, and power are their own goals.
 - Honor – valuing personal integrity, trustworthiness, and the fulfillment of one’s word above all else.  Keeping your promises and honoring individual commitments is not just a matter of social expectation, but a core part of one’s identity and moral code.
 - Individualism - each person is accountable solely for their own success, survival, and happiness.  Freedom, self-reliance, independence, and the courage to carve one’s own path, often in the face of adversity or uncertainty, are valued.  Venturing into the unknown, relying on one’s own skills, resourcefulness, and determination to overcome challenges.
 - Pride - the belief that personal dignity and reputation are of utmost importance. Individuals driven by a sense of self-worth and accomplishment. Pride motivates people to maintain high standards, fulfill promises, and act in ways that bring respect to themselves and their community.
 - Self interest - individuals should prioritize their own needs, goals, and well-being before others.  Putting oneself first is about recognizing that a healthy, thriving individual is the ideal member of a group.
 - Stoicism - the belief that suffering is ultimately an illusion, something that can be transcended through reason and acceptance.  Individuals strive to remain impassionate in the face of adversity.  The stoic approach teaches that most external events are beyond our control, only how we react to them are.
 - Superiority - the idea that their own race, culture and religion are superior to others.  This ethos often leads to isolationism, xenophobia and genocidal campaigns.
 - Tribalism – the needs of one's clan or tribe come before all other obligations.  Individuals are expected to support, defend, and advance the goals of their tribe or clan, seeing these bonds as sacred and unbreakable.
 - Valor - unwavering commitment to face danger, adversity, or overwhelming odds with bravery and determination.  Acting with courage, not for personal gain, but out of a sense of duty, honor, or the desire to protect others is preeminent. Valor means standing firm in the face of fear, risking one’s own life when the situation warrants it.
 - Zen - the understanding that the natural order of the world is a dynamic balance between cooperation and competition, i.e. the "circle of life."  All living things exist in a web of interconnected relationships, where it is essential that collaborative and competitive forces remain in balance.  There are always winners and losers, but balance is needed otherwise the whole web collapses.

Ethos can be used to not only to define the fundamental character of individuals and groups in the campaign world the TM creates, they can also guide how these groups will interact with each other.  Differences in ethoses can often become the cause of conflicts between groups, and these conflicts can be used to shape a campaign world.  Creating conflicts in ethoses can also give the players a way to choose sides.  Which ethos do they relate to, and why?
Each individual form a region or group normally inherits the ethos characteristics from their background, or from the groups they come from.  However, and individual’s ethos often varies from the stereotypical ethos form the group they came from.  
The following table can be used to randomly select ethos characteristics based on the alignment of an individual or group.  Both the lawful vs chaos dimension and good vs. evil dimension can influence ethos, so there are three tables for lawful, neutral, and chaotic alignment, and each table has good, neutral, and evil characteristices.  These tables can be used in two ways:

1.	They can be used to randomly generate an ethos for a group.  Select on ethos trait randomly from each table.  Because there are two tables, sometimes a trait can be generated which is misaligned with the other traits already selected.  If this happens, keep the previous trait and roll again for the second trait.  The table is not meant to be prescriptive, its just a way to create an ethos to add dimensions to the world the TM is creating
2.	The tables can also be used to generate individual NPC ethos traits.  In this case, start with the stereotypical traits for the group the NPC comes from, and add one new trait from each table.  In this scenario, if you roll a random trait which is contradictory to a stereotypical trait from the NPC’s background group, discard the trait from the background, and instead use the randomly selected individual trait.  But, if you roll a second trait that contradicts a previously generated individual trait, just roll again.
